Devin Seidel' --- Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Abbati ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a writer I mainly need to focus on condensing my thoughts and being aware of run on sentences. While writing I often ted to get carried away with the topic I am writing about which ends up causing me to create several run on sentences. Most of which, my ideas are not conveyed in a coherent manner. In the last several years of high school I have made a very clear effort to change this problem. Through the use of commas, semicolons and colons my writing has become more condensed and easier to process. The realization that this skill is important came to me when my teacher had my class switch papers with each other, and we peer graded each others works. Reading through someone\'s paper that had so many mistakes similar to mine made realize that in order for myself to grow as a writer these types of things, being run on sentences, had to change. For example in a past research project I wrote " This study is an observational epidemiological study that uses primary and secondary sources as a method of data collection, it involves research on the effects of ultrafine particles on cardiovascular disease while also looking into the emitters of ultrafines in rural communities.", this is a perfect example of a run on sentence. This sentence was then changed to "This study is an observational epidemiological study that uses primary and secondary sources as a method of data collection. It involves research on the effects of ultrafine particles on cardiovascular disease, while also looking into the emitters of ultrafines in rural communities." it does not take a lot of thought to change these sentences only a few minutes of reading through the paper that has been written. Areas I would like to develop within my writing is to be able to write a strong introduction paragraph. Organizing thoughts has never been my strong suit as a writer and I would really love to be able to develop a strong attention grabbing introduction paragraph. As a writer I enjoy trying new things and cannot wait to improve upon these skills. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joelmy Acevedo ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Over the summer I had a research paper due and looking back on it there were many things that I could have added in order to obtain a higher score. As a result of this score, I plan to focus on every aspect of the writing process. I am not as much as a good writer that I want to be and I am hoping INTD will help me. One skill that I am good at now is analyzing my evidence. Explaining evidence is an important aspect in a paper because it shows that you make sense of the evidence. In my paper over the summer I succeeded in using the strategy when i said " ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Brown writes "The influx of laborers willing to do work others might avoid, or willing to work for lower wages, could help keep the cost of some goods and services in check, thereby constituting a benefit to the American consuming public (423)". In other words, continuing to do these minimum wage jobs and keeping the food resources at low cost helps many Americans and most importantly the economy." This shows how I gave a piece of evidence and broke it down to go more into depth of what it's saying and eventually how it connects to my thesis. The skill I believe I need to focus on the most is articulating my thoughts more efficiently. This is an important skill to have because it is how the readers will interpret my writing. I must give them something to think about and do it in a way where they won\'t have to question what I am trying to say. This also correlates with the skill of connecting ideas in my essays. I believe this is another important skill in writing essays because it bridges your entire paper together. Without this skill then there won\'t be a consistent flow of ideas in your paper which makes it hard to understand. My professor over the summer helped me to bring awareness of the importance of this skill. He enlightened me on the fact that this skill will inevitably follow me throughout my college years. I am confident in improving my writing by revising drafts extensively, looking over your work many times and having others do it as well can really improve drafts. Including revising I will find templates that have a systematic structure before i begin my paper. These templates will be able to give me an idea of how to connect ideas and where to place them. Going forward, these are the steps I will be taking in order to refine my writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jonathan Ackles ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ Jonathan Ackles ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD-106-01]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [ When I am writing a serious work like an essay or a research paper, I use a system that was imbibed by my high school English teachers. This system consisted of presenting a claim or idea (for example from my last AP English exam I stated that Hamlet was so obsessed with avoiding purgatory after seeing the ghost of his father that he believed killing his uncle while at prayer would nullify his chances of going to heaven). I would follow this idea or claim with a quote or description of the events described in the passage(ie.using Hamlet's soliloquy or describing the back and forth that occured in his mind). Depending on the writing task, I would have also presented a counter argument and then discredited it with a secondary example or quote from the text. I was always told this skill was important because it always gave credit to the author of the work I had to use and it acknowledged a dissenting opinion. I feel that although I am well practiced at the skill of presenting an argument, I often struggle with how to properly cite or paraphrase a work without damaging the flow of the essay. I am also afraid of sounding like I am merely regurgitating older arguments without adding anything new to the discussion.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Liam Adams ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Liam Adams]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [When writing I try my best to develop a captivating hook to hopefully gain the attention of the reader, so they are truly interested in my writing.

It is good to get the attention of the reader within the first few lines of the reading because most people will not continue to read past that if they have no interest in what they are reading or do not know what the reading is about in the first place. I was taught this skill in the eighth grade and it has stuck with me ever since because it is a very important skill to have when writing. An example of when I would use this would be when writing an introduction to a paper like "]{data-contrast="auto"}[Throughout the novel, "The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D.

To act like this is something I am perfect at would be completely untrue, however I always make sure to pay careful attention to how my sentences are structured. Paying attention to grammar is very important when it comes to writing on more of a professional level. Grammatical mistakes make themselves much more obvious in a piece of writing, especially when said writing is reviewed by someone who has studied syntax thoroughly. It seems easy to excuse grammatical mistakes, but even making small ones will weaken your writing and and can discredit any point that is trying to be made. I was once a lost soul in the world of syntax, without a clue as to why sentence structure mattered. I couldn\'t distinguish a comma from a semicolon, let alone comprehend what either did. When I took an interest in journalism sophomore year of high school, my gramatical ignorance became the problem of my teacher Mrs. Przysbz. The first piece I handed to her came back to me with more corrections than I could count, it wasn\'t until around a month later however that she became so fed up with my mistakes she decided to set me straight. I had never planned to do anything to improve my writing, I just corrected the mistakes she made me aware of time and time again. Mrs. Przysbz realized this and one day she spent the whole day explaining everything I failed to understand about grammar in the first place. While I wouldn\'t say im someone who never makes mistakes while writing, I can proudly say I am much more apt to catching the ones I do make. Something I would like to focus on while studying at Geneseo is learning to write in a more professional tone. My informal diction and style of writing is effective when im writing an opinionated or satirical piece, but it rarely proves useful when writing a serious piece that will be reviewed by a professor.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Queenie Adams =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I write my papers, I focus on including facts that I believe support my topic. Most of the time, my teachers tell me that I include way too many facts that sometimes, there are facts that just do not need to be in my essay. Instead, I should focus on analyzing those facts and making connections in order for my paper to become strong. I usually start with a planning page before I begin writing my essay. This planning page includes all the quotes and information that I feel supports my paper. An advice I received from one of my teachers was that although having a planning page is a good idea, instead of just having quotes that I plan on including in my paper, I should analyze the quote and note to myself about how the quote connects to the topic and the other quotes that I have. Before this advice, I used to put all the quotes I thought supported one another together in my paper without any explanation. For instance, in one of my papers, I wrote, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[In an interview with Mrs. Bee Jenkins, she says that the men in the marches were armed with guns, therefore, they were well protected and ready to shoot if the whites decided to start anything.

The placement of commas, periods and especially more advanced punctuation like colons, semicolons and dashes is something I find difficult today. This skill is important to me because it makes my writing sound choppy and inarticulate. My lack of knowledge about advanced punctuation also makes my writing appear amateurish both visually and in the way, it sounds when read. Revisions on submitted work by a couple of professors and helpers in the writing center helped me deal with this so I've been able to improve a little. The information in the INTD 106 punctuation module also helped me a lot. The module had a great format which broke the correct types and uses of different punctuation marks in a concise and methodical way. The BBCs article details a groundbreaking policy proposition by the leader of the Liberal Democrat party Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats came forward with details of the proposition on an interview televised by the BBC's Andrew Marr.

Cable justifies the policy's steep cost by proposing "a tax on people's gifts through their lifetime" and a scrapping of the Inheritance tax. The bill while seeming purely economic may also hold the keys to many social issues in the United Kingdom. Cable explains that the bill and the requisite tax increases and decreases were needed because "the inequalities of wealth are massive and growing and one of the major sources of underlying dissatisfaction".

After I write, I will review my work to determine if I used words that truly and accurately conveyed my intended message. If I feel as though I did not make the piece of writing engaging, compelling and smoother to read, I will make edits and use a thesaurus to expand the vocabulary. For example, a revision I made in my last essay was: "The hills and water are home to a great community." I recreated this sentence to, "Its rolling hills and beautiful harbor are home to a wonderful community." The more descriptive and visual language helps to generate a more vivid picture in the reader\'s mind. Using descriptive language is beneficial for both the reader and writer. It allows readers to take away core information because they feel as though they are reading something with greater depth. For the reader, I believe it is more enjoyable to read something that is vivid in description because it allows for a clearer image and understanding of what the author is intending to convey. During my years of high school english, my teachers undoubtedly had a great impact in developing my skills as a writer. Developing our vocabulary was always a huge topic because our teachers wanted us to mature into writers capable of both cultivating our thoughts and effectively transmitting them to the audience. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Initiating any writing project has been something that I invariably found to be difficult. The first sentence is particularly difficult for me. I find it challenging to draft an opening sentence that will quickly engage the reader and compel them to continue reading.

Throughout my writing career I have had many teachers that focused on a multitude of aspects of writing. But none spoke louder than the emphasis my senior year of highschool english teacher, put on creativity and uniqueness. He did so by creating a template which forced unique topic sentences and clear thesis statements. To quote one of my recent academic writings, one example would be that I started with a boring and unclear topic sentence like "Social movments are very important in the history of America, it has changed society for the better such as giving women the right to vote, abolishing slavery and a lot of other important American social movments". Then growing to a unique and creative one such as, "Without social movements how would people have the voice that they deserve in the perpetual fight for equality and freedom? Social movements have changed society for the better throughout the course of history, and without the compelling leaders that set these movements into fruition women wouldn't have the right to vote, the chains of slavery could never have been broken and society could still be plagued by alcoholism, domestic violence and an almost worthless working class." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue to grow as a writer one aspect that I will be focusing on is creating more well structured thesis statements and further establishing it more thoroughly throughout the essay.

I was taught this writing strategy by professor Wensel who I had over the summer for the AOP summer program of Geneseo. This was a great way in helping me further my writing because previously I was more of a general writer. I lacked in the essence of elaborating when it came to diving in and getting to the core of my point. This template and way of writing developed my analysis more by going beyond my point to get my point across. For instance in my previous research paper I stated " Teens mental well being is crucial in preparing them for adulthood. Site addiction comes with a price to pay and that can be a great loss if one surrenders to its tricks of having the most likes, comments, views and approval. Robson claims " FOMO is a relevant determinant of particular online self-promoting conducts"( 2018).

When writing I do not end off greatly, I would like to enhance more on my conclusions and wrapping up my points, so that readers leave satisfied and well informed on my overall topic.

For example when I used a quote in my college essay by Elon Musk as he said, "I could either watch it happen or be a part of it," I wrote how the quote related to me and further explained why he was one of the people I chose to quote. In other cases, when given a book of some sort and having to pick out a quote and explain it, I tend to write, "This quote can show how..." and briefly explain the thought process behind the quote to help the reader better understand what is said.

This taught me to isolate what point i\'m trying to get across, cite the information you are putting into your writing and then finally explain what the quote's meaning you incorporated is. An example would be if I was writing about how summer is the best season, instead of simply placing a quote in your writing without explaining it such as I disagree with Document one for stating that, "Many people dislike like summer due to the scorching temperatures." Instead I would use ICE and it would look more similar to the next example. Example 2: although some may agree with Document one for stating, "Many people do not like summer due to the scorching temperatures." there are many ways to combat the heat. For example, The water. Whether it\'s the beach, a pool, or a lake, the water will cool you down. Don't feel like getting wet? No problem turn the air conditioning on in your house and stay cool.

I focus on these the most because, they hold the most information throughout the paper. I want my body paragraphs to be filled with the most information and content, so my reader can understand what is being talked about. I also focus on these the most because I want my point and argument to be clear, which is important in writing. I learned to do this when I was in eighth grade from my English teacher Ms. Kunz. She told us that our information was the biggest part of the paper. She gave us a template to follow for our body paragraphs. We would have a topic sentence, example, explanation, transition, then repeat to create a body paragraph. So I always state my fact for example "Escobar-Viera et al. (2018) explained that those who experienced cyber-bullying had also experienced the feelings of depression". Then I state my explanation "When faced with experiences such as cyber-bullying, they feel put down and not wanted by anyone or anything. The person feels that they longer have any way to escape, and they are trapped with nowhere to go now". The thing I need to work on going forward the most in my writing is my introduction paragraph writing skills. Since I focus more on my body paragraphs, I tend to neglect my introduction which is one if not the biggest part of the paper. This is because it leads the reader into what you are going to be talking about throughout the writing. It also hooks the reader into reading the rest of the writing which is key. Perhaps I should write it last, so I can work on it last and organize it with all the information I have gathered throughout writing the bodies. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rachel Anker ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I believe the strongest aspect of all essays lies in the thesis statement. This assertion is the basis of all essays and therefore the most important part. After building my foundation that is my thesis statement, I can confidently develop my supporting claims to flesh out the rest of my essay. I have learned in my past writing that an outline breaking down each paragraph is imperative to crafting a successful essay. I numerically categorize each paragraph and then sort my supporting facts, quotes, and references into where they belong in my essay structure. Having a clear thesis and essay structure is important to keep the reader engaged. If my thesis statement and what supports this statement is lost in translation, then I will lose the reader and my essay will not succeed. My past teachers have shown me how helpful it is to make sure my topic is as clear as possible in my mind before I begin writing it down. If I do not take the time to fully develop my thesis and essay structure, my writing often loses focus and my thoughts are not communicated as clearly as they could have been if I had taken the time to write an outline. In my high school essay, "How a Blind Person Can Live a Normal Life," I broke down my essay structure by introduction, sections, paragraphs, to finally a conclusion. This method helped me clearly convey each supporting fact that backed up my claim. I was able to develop a clear narrative to my essay, which helped to keep the reader engaged and also made the topic easily digestible. Despite having a clear idea of what I want to write and how to support my ideas, I often have to pay particular attention to my grammar. I always have to double-check my work in order to make sure I do not submit any grammatical errors.

Being transparent in your conclusion helps the reader have no doubt of the intended purpose that the writer is trying to portray to the audience. Throughout my high school English experience, I have been taught that the conclusion is the most important part of the essay and that without a strong conclusion some major points can be left up for interpretation. I would revisit every major point of my essay in the order of which I first addressed the point to ensure that I don't miss a key concept by accident. An example of this would be if I was writing an essay about literary terms, instead of saying "metaphors and similes are both used to compare things but in different ways" I would say, " metaphors and similes are both used to compare things but a simile uses the words 'like' and 'as' while a metaphor does not". As I continue, I would like to focus on finding and implementing supporting details into my writing. I feel that I don't use an acceptable amount of detail to support my thesis. I believe that if I improve this I will be able to develop an essay better. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Vanesa Argueta ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on communicating directly in the emails I send to others and in the most professional manner. By introducing the message with the intent immediately and closing with the appropriate attitude. For instance, in an email I wrote to the person who hired me for my job during the summer began with, "Good Afternoon Mr. Lee, I am contacting you in regards of my application submitted for the sleep-away camp last Thursday." Here I clearly introduced the topic of discussion in a respectful manner by beginning with 'contacting you in regards of' instead of 'asking about...' Although I try to communicate directly and effectively to others in emails and letters, I face a consistent difficulty when writing my essays. I have always struggled with word choice throughout my writing. Instead of speaking on a simple message to another person, I overthink the process when I am connecting ideas or introducing them in my academic writing. I tend to overly repeat certain words throughout the text or choose the wrong ones in sentences, leading them to be run on sentences or too wordy. I have always had difficulty with my sentence structure and it has the biggest insecurity in my writing. I begin to think that the sentence without certain words or structure would be "too simple" and use many unnecessary words. A lot of the time I wouldn't be able to pick up which ones are essential and which are simply fluff. This writing skill is important because it is one of the key components to clearly being able to send your message across to the reader effectively. This skill also helps develop a style of writing that can help my performance as a writer. A person that has helped shaped my writing was my English teachers in high school that have set up a guideline for my essays and methods of analyzing texts. I try to continue using these methods and look back on essays I have written in the past and have gotten feedback on. I also try to use the Writing Center here on campus to get feedback from fellow students. I have also been trying to improve this weakness by writing out different ways of communicating the idea to the reader and choosing the piece that is the clearest. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Justin Arilotta ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ I focused on making sure that my thesis was specific enough and that I made changes to it based on my starting introduction.I tried to express my thoughts confidently and make sure it made sense within the context of my introduction. I feel as if this skill of creating a solid thesis statement is really a big part in an essay and really gets the reader hooked onto what you are writing about. In the past I have had teachers go over my work on my thesis statement to help shape me into a better overall writer and that way every time I write my thesis statement then ill have an idea what to write whenever I start working on a thesis. For example my last paper I wrote in high school my teacher looked at it before I made a final draft for it and made me revise some parts that did not go well with the ultimate whole introduction. Another area that I could develop in is making sure everything connects back to my thesis statement. My teachers in the past would always make sure that I stay on the right track with my body paragraph and make sure it all relates back to the main concept.I also think for the future when I write essays that I could work on making sure I write a well constructed essay that always connects back to my thesis statement that way my essay flows well and sounds good.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tyler Arilotta ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus mainly on the sentences that I put into my introduction, along with the thesis statement. I focus on the introduction because it sets the tone for the whole essay. The introduction will either pull the audience to want to keep reading the essay or making them not interested. Another reason that this writing skill is important is because the introduction shows the audience what the rest of the paper will be about. Throughout highschool, teachers have influenced me to write a better thesis and introduction paragraph. My history and english teachers gave me organizers to help me arrange the specific parts of my essay. The first group would include background information and my thesis statement. The next group would include evidence and reason to back up my thesis. The third group would include the conclusion of the essay, which would end the essay with giving background This organizer would help me put both factual and meaning into the introduction I also work on trying to explain what a quote means that I put into my essay. An example of this would be, a quote from an essay I wrote last year based on the topic of Infant Mortality. " The infant mortality rate in Cuba is only 4.0 deaths per 1,000 live births. In the United States , its 5.9. Meaning that American infants are almost 50 percent more likely to die than Cuban infants." I make sure that I explain the quote instead of writing about another topic. I prefer my essays to be organized and understandable.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward I would concentrate on my evidence and closings to essays. I would also like to work on finding concrete and factual evidence to use towards my topic. I tend to rely more on more of my thoughts than facts and statistics.

I attempt to be precise in how I string words together to form a sentence. With this, I hope to ensure that I properly convey cohesive thoughts that appear fluent. While writing, I express my thoughts, and I find that this is done best when I am confident that the words I am using are meaningful. I think that the proper use of language is the most essential piece of writing, because without the effective use of an expansive vocabulary, there is no creativity within a text. Throughout the college admissions process, I consistently worried about being able to best represent my character in the 650 words that the Common Application accepts. I had worked on my college essay with my eleventh grade English teacher, Mr. Nava, whose largest criticism of my writing was too much consistency in my language. He had told me that I couldn't best represent myself using weak phrasing. He also taught me the difference between concrete and abstract language. I felt this advice to be true because the writing that I most enjoy is comprised of rich language. By rich language I am not alluding to crafting too complex of sentences, but rather choosing words you feel are expressive of your thoughts. To revise, I felt the need to expand my vocabulary. I think the use of more intellectually crafted language allows my writing to be more eloquent and communicative. To illuminate this using an academic example, in a previously written essay for humanities, I wrote "In *The Apology*, Socrates decides that the accusations against him are unjust." To use more concrete and specific language, I could have rather expressed my thought by writing, "In *The Apology*, Socrates chooses to refute the accusations made against him regarding his supposed impiety and corruption of the youth." The second sentence is more elaborative and specifically regards the text. While both sentences reference the text, the second will allow the reader of my essay to better recall upon the text because the particular example used is elaborated upon, and specific. I acknowledge that like communicating, writing is best done with a broad vocabulary. In my future writing, I hope to not only use specific language but to use it correctly. I find when using language that is creative and stands out, I can often misuse words and place them into the incorrect context. I hope to avoid this and rather strengthen my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katherine Arriaga =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Katherine Arriaga]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [4 September 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Writing is a skill that holds a high purpose in our education system because it is a way to easily and formally express thoughts to others. All of my past teachers placed a strong emphasis on the ability to write, and throughout my years of schooling, I have picked up on habits I continuously use in my essays. One skill I focus on is the ability to use the "they say, I say" method. This method is important when writing papers, especially if on the subject of history, because it establishes the writer\'s opinions, without the paper being too biased. If the author does not use the perspective and writings of other people, their own works appear to be one-sided and unreliable. This literary tool was taught to me by my eleventh grade English teacher. He pushed his students to mention the opinions of others in our essays, and then either agree or disagree in your own words. With his guidance, I soon made it a point to begin my paper with an argument of definition: establish your argument with the common denotation known to others, and then build off of this with your own opinions. This skill helped me to pass the advanced placement exam for United States History, because when I was asked to establish my argument, I used the "they say/ I say" method. When asked to discuss the effects of the civil war in the south, I began my essay with the information explicitly stated in the documents, and in the next paragraph I wrote about my own interpretations about how the region dealt with the aftermath of a war.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Although I am confident in my aforementioned ability, I am still not a perfect writer by any means. One aspect that I would like to strengthen is the sophistication with which I write. Generally, my writing comes off as informal. I tend to use far too much passive language, and my vocabulary tends to be quite limited when I am making a point. With this class, I would like to write powerful papers that have the voice of an adult, not a child fresh out of high school. Though it will be a challenge, I am willing to improve upon my writing.

This skill is important because i\'m not able to get my true thoughts down as I hope too. There seems to be a disconnect from my thoughts to the actual words and it affects my writing. I noticed that I had this issue when i was in my tenth grade English class. We were asked to write a response essay to the Great Gatsby, which I knew the answer and what I wanted to write. I was well informed on the topic and the book. I sat at my desk for 20 mins trying to find a way to get my opening paragraph on the page.

In other words, I often struggle with keeping consistency with the past and the present. My teachers have told me that it's almost as if the sentences I portray are traveling through time when they shouldn\'t be. This is known as tense shifting. This is a significant component of writing because it allows sentences to be more coherent, which is also in correlation with verb agreement. For example, "Dendy articulates the repetition of history and how it has given him inspiration and the ability to artistically create his own form of ingenuity. He signified the importance of reviewing dances from past cultures and time periods as a way to educate and fulfill our understanding of dance history. Dance historians are set out to discover the physical and intellectual aspects of dance and 'understand the complex interconnections between bodies, movement, and other social practices', and inform us about the world." In this example, I shift from present to past by using the world "articulates" and then later transitioning into "signified" thus indicating an incoherent use of tense. In order to prevent this error from occurring, I need to be more aware, read my work out loud, and decide what tense I want my writing to be in. However, one of my strengths as a writer is my use of figurative language and sensory details. This is a crucial component of vividly conveying imagery so the audience can picture the environment I'm describing. For example, "Hooks describes the painful truth of black youth and education. Battling the negative connotations placed on her race, attempting to not be characterized by the pigment of her skin, and losing the pleasure and love that school had given her. I admire her inspiration from Paulo Freire who inspired her to think about pedagogy and valued that learning does not have to be constrained but it can be free, similar to that of a bird whose wings have been clipped for far too long." Overall, I hope this class will help me improve my writing without losing my creative style. I need to not be afraid to ask others to read over my work and make sure my sentence structure makes sense. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lukas Austin ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my entire career as a writer, I've always been told I have a good voice.

Many, many teachers that I've had have complimented me on this, whether it be through notes on the paper itself or comments made directly to me. Voice is one of the most important skills in writing because it allows a connection between the reader and the writer, it bonds them in a way. The voice of the author allows the reader to see them as an actual human with feelings and thoughts, rather than a robot spewing out facts. Without a voice, a writer is nothing more than a sheet of paper with black markings on it, with a voice a writer can turn this into a masterpiece.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Some of my favorite teachers have helped me hone this skill, always allowing me to express myself, and never getting too mad at me if I got a little out of hand (although, I got put in my place if my writing got a little too, let's say provocative).

Transitions prevent sudden concept changes in your essay and helps the reader understand better what is going on without gettting confused. Transitions also help by establising logical connections between sentences and paragraphs. My high school teachers have really emphasized the importance of transitions in my papers and it has sticked with me throughout my writing as a student. I have had trouble with this in the past and am looking to improve the concept of transitioning in my writing. For example in my research paper about climate change I wrote \"First, one of the concerns that climate change has is the effects that it has on the Amazon rainforest and its inhabitants of this vast land\". and then I wrote \"Furthermore, global warming has many negative effects on the environment that is affecting both humans and animals\". These two ideas do not have much in common and I should\'ve done better connecting the two paragraphs so the flow of the essay would be much more smoother.

Throughout high school, my various English teachers have explained and shown example, after example of essays with weak thesis compared to strong ones. The essays with the stronger thesis always were graded higher and easier to follow. For example, if I was writing an essay to prove climate change, instead of my thesis being: 'climate change is real,' a better option would be, 'climate change is caused by human activity, as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth\'s natural processes.' This writing skill has helped to improve my writing tremendously, by making them more thorough and easier to follow.\ Going forward, I'd like to develop the skill to closely link my quotes with their explanations. I think I have trouble putting my thoughts into full statements that make complete sense.

I believe this is a very important habit to get into when writing academic papers, especially for myself since I'm not the best when it comes to spelling and grammar. This is because when it comes to writing a paper, even if you read it over multiple times to check for errors, someone else may be able to point out errors you didn't catch and help make your overall paper sound better when read. Also, the person could have suggestions on adding or removing content such as needing to make a stronger argument for one of your points in argumentative papers. Peer editing became a part of my writing process in my twelfth grade English class when my teacher would make us have two peer edits on our papers before we could submit a final draft. Peer editing helped me the most in my research paper that I had to do at the end of my senior year. I was writing a paper comparing scientific explanations on the creation of the universe to religious creation stories. In the paper, I had a lot of information on the Big Bang Theory, so my first section of the paper was strong. However, I was just trying to get to ten pages after that point so the rest of my essay wasn't as good as it should have been. During peer editing, one of my editors told me to put more information about the religious creation stories as it would make the paper more interesting. I followed their advice and I think without it, I wouldn't have gotten as good as a grade that I got on the paper. I believe that learning writing skills really can help you to not only get a better grade on your academic papers, but also help to make the paper more enjoyable to read overall. Writing skills are very important to learn in order write very good academic papers.

One example I used to prove my point was, "After Woland commands Koroviev to make sure Nikanor Ivanovich doesn't return, Koroviev calls the Russian police and informs them about Bosoy speculating foreign currency. They go to his house and easily find the money given to him from Koroviev and he is taken away by the police.

These elements are the framework of a piece as they provide a first impression, establish credibility, and then in part reiterate and summarize the important evidence of the piece. I try to form a sentence or two that really draws the reader into my work. I have always been encouraged by teachers to give a quote as my first sentence in my introduction. This technique has been one that I use frequently. For example, when I was writing a paper on the worth of a college degree, I started the introduction with a quote from Warren Buffett saying, "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get". I have learned that quotes place emphasis on the topic of the piece with knowledge coming from someone other than the writer. Before I learned this strategy, I would just start off with a statement such as, "The value of a college degree is often questioned but it is worth it". It does not effectively prove my thesis. After learning the strategy of synthesizing my final thoughts for a conclusion, I would just restate the into with different words. Now I would say something like, "In today's society, white-collar jobs are more likely to lead an individual to a higher income and more satisfaction". As I continue through this course and other writing courses in my future, I would like to focus on writing details in my own words. I struggle to paraphrase the thoughts and ideas from documents, so I usually quote other people. I find it hard to use my own knowledge when I'm writing a paper based on another source. I feel as if these experts know more about the topic than I do, so I tend to use their words and examples. To develop more on this weakness I could annotate the text and put it in my own words. I could also relate the text to my own experiences. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julia Balzafiore ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Julia Balzafiore\ Professor Paku\ Conventions of College Writing\ 5 September 2019\ Consciously, I focus on having a wide vocabulary. This proves to be a very important writing skill as it helps writers to grow. Additionally, they can portray their text however they want for their audience. I started to become aware of this skill during my senior year of high school, in a program called Senior Experience, where the class was assigned to read and analyze an article every week. These articles were written by different authors and therefore, as a student, I was exposed to a wide variety of vocabulary and how it shapes a text. The words I was taught to use during elementary school drastically changed and grew towards the end of high school. The common vocabulary includes simple words such as tells, says, shows, because, also, good, explains, etc. Although this use of vocabulary was able to get me through elementary school and most of high school I knew I had to broaden my vocabulary, starting my new journey in Geneseo. To improve upon this writing skill I began using a thesaurus as I wrote responses, essays and emails. For example, the alternative words I use for "tells" are: illustrates, portrays, emphasizes, expresses, depicts and clarifies. As another example, alternative words I can use for "because" are: as a result of, by cause of and due to. To further display my ability to widen my vocabulary I will provide examples of prior sentences within this self reflection and alter vocabulary when possible. In the second sentence I stated "This proves to be a very important writing skill as it helps writers to grow", I could revamp the sentence by stating "This proves to be an essential writing skill as it helps writers to flourish". In the sixth sentence I stated "The words I was taught to use during elementary school drastically changed and grew towards the end of high school", I could revamp the sentence by stating "The words I was taught to value within writing during elementary school transformed drastically towards the end of high school". I enjoy studying learning skills, especially writing skills, as a result of beginning school at Geneseo. I would like to see my learning skills expand, allowing me to succeed in my classes and use the same skills after college when applying for a job.\ Going forward I need to work on grammar and sentence structure within my writing. I have never formally learned grammar or sentence structure in high school and have just used my experience and prior knowledge in my writings, as well as personal research. I would like to learn proper grammar and sentence structure so I can revise my own writings with confidence. I will be able to strive for this goal by understanding/completing assignments for this course and applying what I've learned to my other courses. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mackenzie Bancroft ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I focus on is using precise language in order to create on topic points and arguments. I feel that this particular focus is important for academic writing because it allows for organization within a paper and prevents rambling. In high school, my English teacher often stressed the importance of using proper diction. In his feed back he explained how the manipulation of word choice can drive the focus of a paper and allow for ideas to be clearly expressed without confusing and never-ending paragraphs. One such example of how this precise language has been revised in my experience was in an assignment my class completed after studying the tragedy *Macbeth.* Instead of stating that the titular character Macbeth was a wicked character, which would lead to an unorganized discussion concerning the character's negative traits, I revised my paper to explain how Macbeth portrays a tragic hero. This more precise description of Macbeth's flaws allowed for me to create a paper which focused on how Macbeth's pride and greed lead to his own destructive reign and eventual death. An aspect which I hope to improve upon and develop for my future writing is understanding the mechanics of creating citations in multiple fields of study. All throughout high school the instruction I received concerning citation work was centered on MLA format which we used for our English papers. However, as a science major here at Geneseo I feel that it would greatly benefit my studies to have a concrete understanding of citations in scientific fields. Moving forward, I hope to create and use these types of important citations correctly and accurately in my work. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Anne Baranello ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I consciously focus on as I proofread is Quote Dumping (as my past teachers have so eloquently dubbed it). Quote dumping is something that many people fall victim to in academic writing - it's when the writer inserts a large excerpt of text from another source, in order to quote, analyze, and/or reference without blending/introducing the excerpt correctly (Ex: This is a sentence in the middle of a research paper, and I am about to quote a New York Times article in order to make my point. "This is the quote." As you can see, the quote isn't integrated into my writing whatsoever, but is instead, quite literally, dumped in the middle of it). This is something that I used to do in nearly every paper of mine, until my 7th grade teacher sat me down and explained in depth what was wrong with this technique, and how I could fix it. The best method of fixing quote dumping was to melt phrases or words from the quote you wanted into your writing. For example, instead of dumping the quote, "To be or not to be, that is the question," the writer would instead say something along the lines of: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Shakespeare posed a daring question of philosophy - is Prince Hamlet's life of enduring pain "to be or not to be?"]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* [My 7th grade Social Studies teacher actually wasn't the first person to have told me about this, but before then it never really clicked. From then on, I have been incredibly conscious about my quotes and how they meld with my writing. Even now, years later, I continue to struggle with this aspect of academic writing - knowing that I have to rephrase my quote and integrate it, rather than letting the original author do the talking for me (and they always seem to be better at putting things into words than I am). My most recent work of thorough academic writing is the final research paper I did for Sociology class in my senior year of high school. Here is an excerpt, which shows a decent example of how not to quote dump: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["While on death row, Ford's mental health deteriorated to the point of recognizable schizophrenia, as well as severe paranoia. It is said that Ford referred to himself as John Paul III, and claimed that he was "free to go wherever he wanted" due to the supposition that anyone who attempted to execute him would, in turn, be executed."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my writing at Geneseo and beyond, I 1) definitely want to continue improving my skills at not quote dumping, and 2) I want to learn how to be more clear and concise in my writing. If you couldn't already tell, my writing is far more wordy than it has to be - which, in assignments such as this, is not always a bad thing. But a lot of the time I am writing without a point, which leads me to keep spilling words out onto the page, but none of them actually have any value. This is what I hope to develop over my years at Geneseo, and as an English major. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Paige Bartels =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I focus on is staying on track in my writing. I tend to stray from my main point and begin to discuss subjects that do not support the topic in which I am discussing. For example, in one of my recent essays, I was discussing demographics of children at a specific school. The main point of this short essay was to include what the student population was and how this population was diverse. When rereading my paper, I realized that I had started to talk about the curriculum within the school, which is irrelevant in terms of my main point. My past professors have given me guidance on what is important to include in my papers, and what should be left out. Now, I put more effort into trying to narrow down the information that I put into my papers. This is essential in writing for many reasons. Focusing on the main topic prevents both confusion and boredom for the reader. Creating a focused topic and only including relevant information is crucial for a strong paper. Going forward, I would like to focus on incorporating more vocabulary into my papers. I tend to use the same words repeatedly and find it very difficult to reduce repetition in papers. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jenna Barth ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jenna Barth ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Conventions of Writing]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [4 September 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self Reflection Essay \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When writing, other than the basic content needed, grammar, and structure, I focus on creativity in my essays. Without it, the essay becomes boring, and the readers could easily tune out what I'm trying to say. I like to keep it interesting in order to have my essays stand out against others. My teachers throughout high school, especially my English teachers, have always complimented me on my ability to have my personality jump out on the page. Recently, I had to write a response to a sociopolitical critique that my political science class has been reading for the past few weeks. Within it, I made sure that I kept it interesting not only for myself, but for the reader as well through incorporating sarcasm when discussing Donald Trump. For example, I wrote, "starting in chapter one, Hedges explains the way Donald Trump uses the permanent lie in order to gloss over true issues in America. Global warming? It's fake news, despite all of the concrete scientific evidence." Through sarcasm, the reader gets a sense of my personality and hopefully a sense of humor as well to break out of the methodical, boring structure of the academic essay. It informs while also creating a connection between writer and reader to make it less torturous. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of my downfalls in writing is definitely my lack of organization skills. Most times, there are so many thoughts running rampant in my head that its difficult to write them down in a cohesive manner. For example, I'll start out with one idea and end with a completely different idea without tying the two together. In my head, of course, it makes perfect sense. However, if I were to put myself in the shoes of the reader, I would be completely confused. In high school, I would consistently get points taken off for organization issues, especially when I had a time constraint. In order to fix this, I should start outlining my work beforehand. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Claire Barton =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Claire Barton When writing, I always make sure the concepts and details all flow together. I make sure it is organized and easy to follow. A good structure is essential so that the reader can understand my ideas exactly how I intended. I do this by first providing all of the information to back up my idea. Senior year, I wrote about why I chose the major I did. I started with some reasons:"I love math and kids" and "I believe I have many attributes to make a great teacher".This way, the reader can follow the process of details or examples to arrive at the conclusion of my thoughts and argument for the paper.After, I can easily tie all of the small parts together and state my conclusion to study mathematics and adolescent education. Finally, I like to end with something for the reader to think about. For this paper I chose to hint on all of the possibilities, "a degree in mathematics opens up many doors" In English class, even as a child, I was always given some type if outline. There was the storyline with the climax and the one with a box for each paragraph and even a cutting and pasting one. Organization has been one of key parts of writing since I began so I have gotten pretty good at it. One thing I feel I should work on is editing and revising. I rarely go back and revise something I've written. Rereading a paper once or twice before finishing it is something I could easily do, and it would improve my writing considerably. After reading over this and making some changes, I think it's at its best. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Amanda Bauer ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Dry, boring word choice is no fun for anyone; thus, I focus most on clear and elevated diction when writing. Diction is important because it keeps the reader engaged and excited and is auxiliary in establishing the writer's desired mood. Throughout high school, my eloquence improved significantly with the help of my eleventh and twelfth grade teachers. My twelfth grade, AP Literature and Composition teacher cultivated my growth most by presenting me with two techniques: the first used while writing and the second used when editing. The first technique utilizes tone words used by authors referenced in your writing. An example of this comes from a paper I wrote on Mary Shelly's, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[*Frankenstein*: "Shelley's attention to the macabre sublimity of dreary thunderstorms and isolated tundras, as well the monster's ever-looming presence depicts Victor's feelings of reclusiveness driven by guilty paranoia." Words like "macabre," "isolated," "looming," and "paranoia" are consistent with Shelly's writing and the overall mood of ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Frankenstein]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. The second technique suggests condensing, rephrasing, and elevating word choice in the early stages of editing. Using this technique, the sentence, "Victor Frankenstein, the scientist from Geneva, of Mary Shelley's novel, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Frankenstein]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, reacts not with excitement but fear to his exciting accomplishment; however, Victor is confused and shows way too much enthusiasm for his ability to create life," becomes, "Victor Frankenstein, the mad scientist from Geneva, of Mary Shelley's novel, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Frankenstein]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, reacts not with enthusiasm but horror to his groundbreaking and grotesque accomplishment; however, the misguided scientist shows enthusiasm bordering on obsession for his ability to resurrect a man."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue to write, I aspire to use the passive tense less. My twelfth grade teacher touched upon how convoluted a paper can become when the passive tense is used unnecessarily; however, she did not specify what passive tense was in its entirety or how to fix such writing. I believe that if I can learn to fix this, my writing will become more clear and concise.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Yaro Bautista Martinez ==================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} There a multitude of effective ways to write; writing is something that you could consider to be a personal connection between you and the paper or more likely, the word document. Everyone has little quirks and styles that reflects in the way they write, some people enjoy using quotes and formalities in the papers while others might freestyle or outline. My writing technique is entirely dependent on the purpose of my writing but one technique that always remains for me is transitions. An aspect of writing that may not be my strongest but certainly, one that I will continue to work on is word usage. After mastering these two my writing will increase in effectiveness and comprehensiveness exponentially. When it comes to transitions, I have always seen how important they are to the structure of an academic paper. Transitions help continue a steady flow and help the readers make connections between the different ideas without leaving a large margin for confusion and misunderstandings. The need for transitions is always tricky to notice until the revision process; it takes reading out loud to realize whether a sentence flows or not, but during revision adding transitions has always been something that I focus on doing. While transitions themselves are something I have focused on there are things that I must improve within my academic revision process, such as the aforementioned word usage. As someone that spoke Spanish as my first language, I always found it difficult to choose the right words to say or the perfect words for my sentences. I had an English teacher in 9th grade who would always give me new words and asked me to define them and try to use them the next time I spoke to her; towards the end of the year I felt like my vocabulary had grown exponentially and it was time to put it to the test by working on one of my final research papers of the year. I worked on it and chose to write about renewable energy sources and then after I finished my draft I think I must have revised it 5 times each time changing the word I noticed appeared the most and eventually I felt like my word usage was much more advanced and was certain to get the point across without being repetitive. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lauren Becerra ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ My Writing Priorities ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my writing, I tend to focus on expanding my ideas. Many times, I put too many complex ideas in one sentence, without expanding each separate idea. This causes my writing not to flow, and possibly confuse the reader. When I expand my ideas efficiently, my writing becomes much more understandable, and helps me express my points. This very important to good writing, because without accurate meaning and flow, an essay lacks clearness and this distracts from the original idea, instead of developing it. The reader needs to have a comprehensible sense of what a writer is trying to explain, or possibly argue.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [For me, my mom (an English Lit major from Columbia and Oxford) has helped me throughout my high school career to improve these elements of my writing. By giving me feedback, she helped me understand that my writing needs to go more in depth if I am to explain my ideas more effectively.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [For example, in my senior year of high school I was assigned an essay on the book,]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ The Scarlet Letter, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[specifically about how Arthur Dimmesdale is an ambiguous character]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[In the first body paragraph I state, "He is not willing to share Hester's public shame and punishment. He is claiming that suffering punishment is not as important as feeling guilty." Previously I would have tried to squish those two ideas together, and go straight to text evidence, or to my next point. So initially I wrote, "He refused to share Hester's shame, exhibiting he cannot empathize with her." In the revised version, I analyzed my thoughts more carefully, and using more care in choosing my words, I convey more thoughtful detail to the reader. This squishing ideas together makes my writing sound confused; but when I slow down and really think about what it is I'm trying to say, my writing becomes much more thorough. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [At Geneseo, I hope to improve my use of words, and learn about more writing styles, and techniques that will help me develop my own style, and overall give my writing more variety and funkiness. I don't want my writing to be boring and lack character.

I need to focus more on the reasoning of quotes and aspects of writing. Instead of explaining what a quote means or why an emotion is felt, instead of explaining how the evidence ties in or what is causing the emotion. I explain the quote and the emotion and not touch on why. Being able to show the facts and not state them is an important writing skill because it provides proof and another level to the writing and keeping the reader interested. When writing my college essay, I used a quote "I was extremely nervous" My 12^th^ grade English teacher help me reconstruct the statement and analyze it to bring forward what was making me nervous instead of stating the fact that I was. I went on to talk about my sense and how specific things and visuals made me feel this way. I feel confident in fixing this in the future as well as my time at Geneseo because I am aware of how to fix it and always thinking about how I can explain things rather than state them. This will tie in more and as I use textual based evidence to support claims, I will be aware of this issue and speak strictly on explain the evidence rather than stating what it means. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lauren Beers ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Lauren Beers\ Gillian Paku\ INTD 105\ 5 September 2019\ A writing skill that I have learned to prioritize is incorporating quotes into my writings or manipulating the quotes to prove the claim that I am making. I feel that if this is not done properly, one's claim will not be supported well. In 11th grade, my AP Language teacher taught us a specific way of implementing quotations in our work. We were told to write context, quote, then analysis. However, as I felt more comfortable with the format, my teacher encouraged me to switch around the order of those three parts as I saw fit. This ended up allowing me to begin developing my own style of writing. An example of my manipulation of a quote would be how in a draft I stated, "'Rong then speaks words of inspiration, "My voice re-echoes from heaven to earth, I crack my temples and split my throat in crying out to my fellow-countrymen: revolution is inevitable for China today," (The Revolutionary Army p1). These empowering words began to unite the people, as they started to realize that there was a certain strength in numbers."'. I began by introducing the quote as words of "inspiration". After the quote was incorporated, I used what I was claiming the people felt in order to direct the reader towards how I wanted them to interpret it. I'm glad that I learned to do this so early in my academic career because it is a skill that I use often and will likely continue to use.\ A skill that I hope to develop further is constructing thesis statements. I feel as though sometimes my thesis statements are not as in depth or exact as I'd like them to be. This may be because it is difficult for me to see an author's work as a whole, or pick out a specific theme that I think is strong enough to write an essay about or support. It is possible that if I annotate my readings better, it will be easier to construct a thesis.\ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Juliette Bell =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Juliette Bell]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Professor Gillian Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106 ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [5 September 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ My Writing Style]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ When I go about writing essays, I feel that I do an excellent job in defining my purpose clearly and concisely. Having a clear path/purpose in writing is not only important in helping you understand where you want to go with your essay, but it also helps the reader get the main idea/main point that you're trying to present. I make sure to state my initial purpose right in the beginning of my work. In my Humanities essay about whether Sigmund Freud's work is helpful in the field of psychology, I state right in the introduction paragraph that "Although Freud's ideas tend to be overlooked due to the controversial nature of many of them, there are also many points in the book that remain true to society today and could be quite helpful in understanding the true nature of human beings." Instead of letting the reader guess my opinion, I think that it's important to immediately state the path I plan to take with my essay as early as possible. In the past I tended to stay neutral or take the opposite side and wait until the end to show my opinion, but I think that method can just lead to confusion. For example, I may have just written that "Freud's work is controversial" and not have said that I believe that it could be helpful. That approach would be confusing because then the reader would think that my essay would be about proving him wrong when in actuality it is the opposite. Many of my teachers throughout the years helped shape my writing and showed me how to make my works purpose clearer. I give the most credit to my AP Language Arts and Composition Professor because he worked with me throughout the year to show me how to make my writing more appealing and understandable.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ One aspect that I feel that I need to work on is my grammar and punctuation. I feel like sometimes when I write, I have so many thoughts going through my head and I just scramble to jot them all down. I feel that many times when I read over my work it can be kind of confusing. I also stray from using semicolons or any kind of punctuation that isn't a period or comma. I really want to be able to use different kinds of punctuation in the future because I think that by not using them, I am only holding myself back.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicole Bergeron ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The thesis statement is one of the most important things in a piece of writing. The thesis statement dictates the whole reason for your writing, without it and you just have a bunch of pointless words. Stating your thesis early on is vital but not enough. Throughout your writing the reader needs to be thoroughly reminded of what you're trying to tell them. This is something I always focus on during my revising phase. Some of my recent works include application essays to Brigham Young University. I was lucky enough to have several outside sources offer to read through my essay and make extremely critical comments. The biggest influence on my writing is my Aunt who is currently enrolled in a graduate program at Harvard University in Boston. I strongly believe that without the comments she had made on my writing and aspects she had encouraged me to emphasize I would not have been accepted into Brigham Young University. In one essay I have to explain how my first-year experience at college has challenged me and prepared me for the demanding curriculum of their University. I start by declaring that Geneseo is a "well known University for it's rigor and successful alumni" and how, even though I went through academic and emotional distress that severely hindered me throughout my first year, I persevered. Throughout my essay I point out aspects that support my potential success at Brigham Young such as, "I know how to find and use the resources that are provided to me" by the University and I "genuinely enjoy learning new things in all areas". I am able to answer the prompt and effectively reiterate my thesis statement throughout my writing without sounding repetitive.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I have always, and continue to struggle with fluidly integrating quotes. I try to implement the quotes in a way that they continue my thoughts, but in doing this I often do not provide enough of the quote. Thus, making the quote, not only useless but also, confuse the reader. Many of my high school teachers have commented on this and they have given me suggestions on how to more effectively embed quotes but none had flowed with my writing style. I am always apprehensive of quoting too much and not having enough of my own voice in my own writing. It's so difficult to find the balance between quoting enough to be strong evidence while also not quoting too much to not be able to have my own argument heard. Developing the skills to effectively use quotes in this course will enhance my writing not only for the rest of my undergraduate education but also for my future career. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rachel Bernheimer =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing, I try to focus on keeping my thoughts clear to the reader. Sometimes what I am thinking in my head does not come out on paper the way I want it to. I have had teachers from high school give suggestions on where to place certain sentences for my essay to make more sense. For as long as I can remember, I have always followed the basic writing template we all learn in grade school. I have it engraved in my brain: start out with an introduction, throw some body paragraphs in the middle, and some it all up with a conclusion. For example, writing my college essay was slightly challenging. This is because when I originally wrote the draft, I was well over 650 words. It was difficult for me to take out many parts of my essay, while still keeping my ideas consistent throughout. I began my essay by stating that in May 2015, I was diagnosed with Cushing's syndrome, a benign tumor on my left adrenal gland, which caused the overproduction of the stress hormone, cortisol. Because of this, my left adrenal gland needed to be surgically removed. In my first body paragraph I explained life living with adrenal insufficiency. In my next body paragraph I talked about a new medical diagnoses after a complication of the original one. In another body paragraph, I talked about how I use to be a competitive swimmer, but my illness prevented me from continuing. Therefore, I decided to become manager of the team, so I could still be apart of my "swim family." Finally, I wrapped up my essay by saying that even though I sometimes "feel that the ground is slipping beneath my feet and I am out of control," "I have learned to have the confidence to keep going, keep strong, and keep my head held high." After many drafts and reorganizing, I was successfully able to complete a college essay that was coherent and organized. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I would like to increase my vocabulary when I write. I believe that pieces of writing with more sophisticated language seem more professional. After I write a draft of an essay, I will look up synonyms to words and change them to make it sound better.

I tried to sound intelligent with others peoples thoughts but it doesn't sound like my own voice. My teachers throughout high school, especially senior year explained to us to reword peoples thoughts or use your own to create an argument or agree with it. So, while I was writing a research paper on the death penalty, and I just loaded it with facts like "the death penalty has been abolished from many states except...." Or "264 prisoners were killed from the death penalty, and 10 were proved innocent after the death penalty was given." I did this because it was easier to state facts instead of creating my own opinion. Even though it was a research paper there is room for your opinion without blatantly stating it. Something I want introduce in my writing is being a critical reading and taking the arguments in readings and having an opinion of my own with a larger vocabulary that I use as my own. I feel as though as you grow as a writer having a larger vocabulary helps you out a lot. The Neo-Native Slave Trade class I am taking with Maria Lima is opening my eyes to new and better things. Having an opinion on a topic leads you to many different ideas and questions about other topics. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Anushka Bhatt =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} According to me writing an essay is a skilled way of expressing thoughts and feelings by using words on a paper without any biasness. I focus on the structure of an essay which I think is the most important thing for an essay. It involves knowing the number of paragraphs in an essay, topics that needs to be covered and the order in which they need to be received. If the structure of an essay is not in order it might confuse the readers as it won't match with their logics about the understanding of a specific topic. I took a writing class my first semester in SUNY Geneseo in which I learned from my professor the importance of writing an essay in an order for a better understanding and to convey the message rightly and her notes helped for me to improve the way I wrote essays before I took the class. Like I used to only write the body paragraph and still not exactly have a direction related to the content that I am writing the essay on. And that class explained a way to structure the essay which was DUC(K)S where D stands for direction, U stands for unity of the information, C stands for cohesive, and S stands for support which involves giving facts and examples to support your explanation. For example, one of the common mistakes that I used to write while paraphrasing is writing the same content and not changes much words which can be considered plagiarism for example on my essay related to diseases the line I read from a source was "symptoms of influenza include fever and nasal congestion" and how I paraphrased was influenza has many symptoms and some are fever and running nose. In this a lot of words are same as the original one so the best that I would write after that mistake and learning more about the methods is A stuffy nose and elevated temperature are signs you may have the flu. In future I am looking to improve the ways to write an effective introduction to my essays which can also be called using a hook to engage and attract the attention and interest of the readers. I think I do not exactly know how to introduce a topic and be interesting at the same time. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Palden Bhutia =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When writing I always focus on making my sentences concise and to the point. Often times many people put too much information in their sentences which makes readers confused about what the main idea is. My SAT instructor would always tell me that the answers to the reading section and grammar are always going to be concise. This made me think of why they did this which is to get straight to the point. Also, if your sentences are redundant this will lead to the readers not wanting to pay attention to the text anymore. Many times I write too much and repeat which causes my sentences to lose value. On top of that being concise, it helps your writing flow more clearly. Some ways that I make my sentences concise are by using my template that has words that are unnecessary. My SAT instructor would make me memorize words that if seen would probably not be the correct choice. Some words in my template that should not be placed in the answer choice or in my writing: actually, really, basically, probably, very, and etc. The reason why are these are extra words that if taken out the sentences will still flow. Also, another example of being concise is instead of using "in order to" just replace that with "to". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [What I would want to improve on is diction. Many times my writing insists on basic words. However, by learning how to use more sophisticated language this can make my writing sound and look much better. Perhaps, reading a dictionary could help my diction or by looking up complicated words while in my everyday reading that I don\'t understand. Also, by taking this course I plan to master being concise and increase my diction.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Haley Blaszak =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Haley Blaszak INTD 106 Self-Reflection 1 In my years of education, I have learned to shape and reshape my writing style with the influence of different teachers and professors I have met. One of the academic papers I am most proud of, I wrote in a college writing class in my first semester of college at Kent State University. It was my final project, and a research paper with solutions to a problem of your choosing, mine being a rise in mental health issues. When writing this paper, the aspect that I was most proud in was my ability to research and organize information. An example of this is, "Meditation comes in many different forms, but the key goal is to help the mind and body relax. This can be seen by practicing breathing techniques, stretching, yoga, or any other practice that brings peace to the mind and body." This is just one example of some of the research that went into this research paper out of the six resources that were used. In my opinion I believe this aspect is very important as a psychology major reading, understanding, and dissecting information in scholarly journals because the field is constantly changing with new information on studies, disorders, and experiments. As of right now, the person that helped me to develop my writing skills and style the most was one of my high school English teachers, Mrs. Gillet. In the future of my education at SUNY Geneseo, I would like to further develop my writing skills and abilities to make it as strong and professional as possible. Two of the aspects I would like to most develop in these upcoming semesters include strengthening my ability and comfort in using citations specifically in APA format, because this is the most commonly used format for a psychology student, and I will continue to use this for many years to come. Another aspect I would like to strengthen is my thesis statements in my writing. Thesis statements are important to the introduction and are necessary for a strong entry to the beginning of a paper.

I want to engage the reader while also letting them know what my essay will be about. I also try to get my point across in the introduction, so that it sets the tone for the rest of my essay. Introductions are very important because they set the tone for the rest of the essay. I used to struggle with introductions and thesis statements, but my teacher senior year helped me to improve. For example, this was my introduction for an essay I wrote about peer pressure last year: \"[Peer pressure is a common problem among kids around the world. Peer pressure is when someone is pressured into doing something from their peers. It is a significant problem and causes many people to make very poor decisions that can result in harsh consequences. However, there are certain scenarios that peer pressure can pressure someone into doing something great and beneficial. In the article "How Peer Pressure Can Affect You" by Kathiann M. Kowalski, the author discusses the large effects of peer pressure. Throughout the story "Salvation" by Langston Hughes, Langston Hughes was peer pressured into making a poor decision, and in result he suffered the burden of guilt. Peer pressure is a massive problem that needs to be fixed.\" My argument was that peer pressure had negative effects on people. However, I also had to give a refute and state reasons why people thought peer pressure could have positive effects on people too. I feel like my teacher taught me a lot, but there is still a ton of room for improvement in my introductions. I feel that I can extend my vocabulary and engage the reader better. I want to learn how to give a detailed but intriguing introduction. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lauren Blouin =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing I focus on clarity. Sometimes I have a hard time writing out my thoughts so it\'s very important for me to do this. My high school teachers have helped me improve this by guiding me through the writing process. First, I start a draft and write down my key points or arguments I\'m trying to make, after, I write my reasonings for them. I believe my rough draft helps me set up my paper neatly. My writing has never been strong but I intend to work on it by practicing to layout my paper correctly. In my previous writings I would jump from one thought to another without really explaining myself. This summer I took part in the AOP program and wrote a paper on how pollution affects marine life. In my rough draft I wrote down my key points noise, plastic and oil pollution. Then, I started to make my arguments on how they affected marine life. For example, I wrote \"When the plastics are polluting the sea, it causes entanglement of marine life and digestion of the pollutants.\" During my time at Geneseo I hope to continue to strengthen my writing and work on my organization skills. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alison Bohlen =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Being a talkative person comes with its positives and negatives, in my writing, I tend to ramble. Once I get an idea in my head, I tend to go off on a tangent, making it difficult to write on task. When i\'m writing, I feel the need to describe my arguments in heavy detail which distracts me from my initial intent for the piece. Throughout my high school experience, my teachers would write constant reminders on my papers to saying "Ali focus." Getting an outsider\'s perspective from teachers helped me to become more aware of my faults, and in turn encouraged me in a way that made me always remember their voice in the back of my head while i\'m writing. The method they taught me to remember when I catch myself writing off task was to take my time and really understand the topic, make clear points, and stick to them. Rather than trying to prove that point five million times, even, if most of the times it doesn't even relate to the topic. This skill is important to work on because for a piece of writing to be well thought out, there should not be any topics that don't relate to the overall one. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my English essay last year, l was given a topic to write about, what happened to this person and how did they overcome it. I was writing about Amanda Knox and I got so fascinated i her story that I did not relate it back to how she overcame it. " After 6 months of being in jail, forensics went over the evidence collected and found it to be inconclusive, therefore they were set free, this not only happened once but a second time 6 years later." This had hurt my grade because I only focused on the details of the case rather than how she overcame this. In this class I'd like to continue trying my hardest to stay on topic and fully understand the topic, I want to further my writing skills by being able to master my mistakes. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Preston Boliver ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on implementing transition words and phrases into my writing because it helps the reader make connections or move across ideas smoothly. When reading a paper without transition it can be easy to miss a connection the writer is trying to make. I'm extremely confident in the use of transitions because my English teacher in high school worked directly with me to improve the use of transitions in my writing. Also, the use of my transitions is often commented on by my former professors. The tutoring done with my past English teacher has deeply helped the coherence of writing through the use of transitions. Here is an example of how transitions are beneficial, "too many people get their views from bias political news channels. However, if people don't stay tuned into such media channels, they won't know what is happening." An example of a lack of transition, "too many people get their view from bias political news channels. If people don't stay tuned into such media channels, they won't know what is happening." Clearly the first example got the idea of the statement across to the reader in a much more coherent manner. Going forward I would like to concentrate on the quality of my thesis statement in future papers. I think some of the points of my past papers have not been concise enough for the reader. I feel if I can grasp this skill it will bring my writing to the next academic level. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Samuel Bonderoff ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} My writing quality has grown throughout my years of high school. I am fortunate to have a mother who has worked in higher education for over thirty years now. This has been a significant role in my writing, trying to create a more sophisticated and professional voice that seems to be expected at higher levels of education. I also push myself to be somewhat lyrical, not in a rhythmic sense but to expand the vocabulary in my writing. These examples can be seen in my college essay, \"The difficulties of moving to a foreign country for ten months, on your own, at fifteen years old, seem to be unimaginable. However, I also look back at my exchange as a fond memory, an experience I could never forget, and never want to.\" As you can see in this example, I try to have a flow in my writing by using different vocabulary and making a personal reflection of my experience. Following this more casual interpretation of my Rotary Youth Exchange, I come from a more aesthetic point of view, \"I truly believe that I gained more positives from my exchange than I did negatives. Now, fluent in Spanish, more outgoing, and a better communicator, I see the world as a larger picture than most.\" I will continue to focus on these qualities in my writing while also pursuing new qualities to enhance my writing further.\ An aspect of writing that I have struggled with and look to develop here at Geneseo is using different literary elements. I can use the more simple ones and use many without even realizing it. It is the more complex and deeper thinking literary elements that I hope to tackle throughout this course and the years to come. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Dominic Boscarino =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Dominic Boscarino 9/5/19 While writing I have learned that it is important to get your reader interested and curious as soon as possible. I spend a lot of time and focus on my introduction paragraphs or sentences, to make sure that right away my reader is hooked into my story. I make sure that my reader is going to continue reading, if I didn't do this, I would worry about my reader becoming bored immediately and not wanting to read the rest of the story. My twelfth grade English teacher really pushed this last year because I would write a lot of analysis essays on books and for the first few months every paper came back with a comment "need better introduction" or "need to hook in writer". I changed the beginning of my stories from thing like "In the book Forest Gump by Winston Groom, Forest can do many amazing things even due to his disability" to something like "Have you ever seen a 6'6, 240 pound man attempt to play harmonica or become and astronaut?" I enjoy spending time to think of something funny or interesting that will hook the reader into my story, I also have areas that need some improving.\ Continuing in my writing career I hope that I can work on describing my main ideas better and by using more clear and precise details and examples. I would like to be able to write more confidently on my own. Be able to talk about my writing, provide examples to discussions and not being scared to share something I wrote. I have never been overly confident about my writing skill whether it was an essay or just a short response question and I am looking forward to increase my writing skill and therefore increase my confidence in myself. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Vrisida Bouzos ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Vrisida Bouzos]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While writing a paper, and even revising it, something that I try to focus on is making the topic of the paper very clear to the reader from the start. If a paper doesn't start off straight to the point then the topic won't be as clear as it should be. For example, as I started writing this assignment, the first time, I was almost done when I re-read what I typed and realized that it didn't make sense and that I barely got to the point of the assignment. Instead of starting the assignment like how I just did I wrote something like "Throughout high school I have written many papers that have all been revised." While that may not be the worst way to start the assignment I have realized, through, the revision, that by starting the paper getting straight to the point will lead to a more concise paper. I have received advice about how to better start essays and other writing assignments from my twelfth grade English teacher, his advice was always to keep it simple and right to the point as if the reader was from a complete different planet and was reading only my paper to understand the topic of whatever I was writing about. It's important for a paper to flow well because it will lead to a better overall paper as a whole. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I want to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo is professional writing.

I am confident in my skills in writing an email however not at the professional level that I would like. I think that there are different professional levels as to how an email should be written.

I learned this because I never used to set up a proper introduction that would lead off my essay. When starting off an essay I always make sure to clearly state the theme or thesis of the essay in the introduction so that the reader will have a clear idea of what the essay is about and what the direction of the essay is heading. I prefer to have it in the beginning of my peice so that when I back up that claim the reader already knows what I\'m trying to prove or convey. My tenth grade english teacher gave us an outline for the introduction that was topic sentence, then the thesis, then you state quickly what points your going to hit without overly describing them. Just describe them enough to keep the reader intrigued and wanting to read more of you paper. I did this when I wrote a report about how a traditional barbie doll can lead to young girls feeling unhappy about their bodies. Unfortunately I don't have that paper anymore but I believe the claim was "Young girls who grew up playing with barbie dolls can grow to have problems with their self esteem." Then I\'d follow up with the topics I'd hit to further prove my point like body dysmorphia, eating disorders, plastic surgery, and the unrealistic body proportions of a barbie doll.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Some areas of development for me as a writer similarly to the person who did the sample piece for this assignment is when doing research or any kind of paper that requires quotes from others, my voice gets lost in the quotes I often string together. I need to have more of my voice shine through and not just the findings of other people. Another area of development I think I need to work on is my confidence in my writing. I feel as though I have not had the same amount of experience in writing as my peers and I\'m very rarely impressed with my writing or confident in it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jacob Branch ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing I focus on is being able to evoke my personality as a writer on the topic of interest I am writing about. This could include adding small comments about the theme or adding a joke that certainly does not distract the reader from the point I want to get across, but still adds some charm to my work. I feel that this helps keep the reader interested and engaged, and encourages them to keep reading. I definitely would not want someone to get bored of my writing, and I believe that my style helps with that issue. My AP Literature teacher had pointed it out to me after I had turned in an essay and told me she thought my style was very interesting. She encouraged me to not completely change, yet still be able to focus on the argument or task at hand. My teacher expressed enormously how much she enjoyed reading my essays, so I chose to continue with my style. An example would be that if I'm trying to convince the reader about a simple debate such as dogs are better than cats, I would make excellent points that support my side. However, I would have to add that I've never had a dog, let alone a pet. I always wanted a dog, and could give excellent reasons for wanting one, but my parents never let me. Small information like this could be funny to some, since I want to convince the reader what I believe in, yet cannot relate to owning a dog. I am confident to say that with my unique aspect of writing, I try to include this style when I can, but most of it comes naturally while I write. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would like to improve on my vocabulary in my writing. Learning new writing skills can be very important for myself as a writer and for the future as well, especially in the real world. I believe having strong vocabulary translates to a strong argument or an intelligent read. Increasing the variety of words I use or how I use them can improve my writing tremendously, and I would love to be able to have this ability in the future. I could start this process by using a thesaurus more while writing so I can convey the same message and use improved vocabulary at the same time.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicholas Brandjes =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Nico Brandjes Self Reflection \#1 9/5/19 \ \ I believe that one of my strongest qualities as a writer is being able to view things from different perspectives. I think understanding possible counter-arguments is an important aspect in any persuasive essay. I also believe that gathering information from many different sources and perspectives is important in research papers and essays. My AP Literature teacher in high school was tougher than most of the other teachers in my school. She really challenged my skills as a writer and held us to a higher standard than the other English teachers in the school. At the time, I was unappreciative, because that meant that we had to do a large amount of revision and work in general, but now I am grateful. In her class, I was once tasked to analyze the play "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead," by Tom Stoppard. In this piece of reading, I was challenged to attempt to analyze a famously absurd and philosophical play. The way I unpacked this was to look at it from many perspectives and I believe that this was the key to understanding the play. The entire thing hinges on a different perspective of two characters usually relegated to the side. My mother was an English teacher when we lived in New York City, and she has taught me that I can always improve upon my writing. She also held me to a higher standard due to her experience, but she always helped me if I came to her struggling with a topic. There are many aspects of my writing that I want to improve, but I think the most important one is for me to try and elaborate more on some things. Occasionally I will state an idea and not elaborate in too much detail, instead switching to another topic. Among other things, this is what I most want to improve in my writing. I hope to improve this as well as the overall professionalism of my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julia Brandow =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Self- Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [After graduating from Geneseo, I plan to become a high school English teacher. Therefore, during my time here, I know that I need to better both my writing and my understanding of writing before I can teach others. I understand that while I consider myself a good writer, there are many things I must improve in order to be great. One aspect of my writing that I plan on focusing on and improving is getting to the point. My writing in the past has often times strayed from the main topic of the piece as a whole, and I often include too much detail rather than giving just enough to explain what is necessary. My goal is to learn how to include enough detail to get my point across, but not too much as to where the reader becomes bored, distracted, or confused. I struggled with this problem during my high school English classes. Though this wasn't a problem in my creative writing classes, it did hinder me when writing timed essays and formal writing pieces. My AP Language teacher in high school advised me to make my writing less about the poetry of it all and more about being sure that the reader is not confused. She told me that it is important for the reader to not be lost in descriptions. This occured when I was writing a research paper about the gender wage gap. My use of multiple facts and statistics, when paired with run-on sentences and too much detail, made for an essay that was more confusing than informative. To combat this, I plan on using less adjectives and attempting to remain on task of the topic, and not to let my mind wander. It is my hope that the classes I take here at Geneseo will not only make my own writing more successful, but give me the information and tools I need to help others be successful writers as well. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lucas Brenner =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a writer I personally like to focus on using text based evidence and examples whenever I write a paper, especially research papers. As a history major I know I'm going to be writing a lot of papers throughout my years here at SUNY Geneseo, so this is a skill I focused on a lot in high school. This skill was always something very important to me to develop because I feel that providing examples and evidence is the most important thing to any argument. It gives the argument more validity and doesn't just seem like you're trying to make and argument appear out of thin air. A lot of my history and english teachers in high school put a lot of emphasis on providing strong examples and text based emphasis in every paper I wrote. Through this constant emphasis I picked up on the importance of this skill. Now I always make sure I provide evidence and text based evidence for every paper I write. In an essay I had to write for AP english literature and composition it had to be a research paper based on an idea from one of the books we read in class. I chose the book "The Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien because I tried to make it the most history nerd essay I could possibly make it. "The Things They Carried" is a Vietnam war novel that explores the ideas of what makes a war story a true war story, the scarring effects of war, and the social political climate of the time period. In the essay I used many online sources and evidence from the text to support my thesis. I wanted to make sure that for each argument I had at least one or two pieces of evidence from the text and at least one or two pieces of evidence from online sources to back up each of claims that I made for my body paragraphs. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [There are two areas I want to work on as I progress through my years here at SUNY Geneseo. One is that I want to keep working on how to improve my argument and be able to add more to the conversation in each of my essays. Another area I want to focus on is my grammar when I write. More specifically I'm really bad at using commas. I don't use them that much when I write causing my essays to appear choppy or as one really long sentence without any pauses to connect the ideas. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kyra Brick ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Kyra Brick]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [Self-Reflection \#1 ]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"}[When writing, I prioritize the state of my thesis ]{data-contrast="auto"}[st]{data-contrast="auto"}[a]{data-contrast="auto"}[tement]{data-contrast="auto"}[, ]{data-contrast="auto"}[a]{data-contrast="auto"}[nd focus a great deal of effort in ensuring that my thesis is ]{data-contrast="auto"}[precise]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-contrast="auto"}[and efficiently]{data-contrast="auto"}[ outlines the ]{data-contrast="auto"}[topic of my work]{data-contrast="auto"}[ because a]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-contrast="auto"}[proper ]{data-contrast="auto"}[thesis statement makes it easier ]{data-contrast="auto"}[to construct a well written ]{data-contrast="auto"}[piece]{data-contrast="auto"}[, ]{data-contrast="auto"}[unmistakably]{data-contrast="auto"}[ outlin]{data-contrast="auto"}[ing ]{data-contrast="auto"}[the most important ]{data-contrast="auto"}[information that will be further built upon throughout ]{data-contrast="auto"}[the]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-contrast="auto"}[entire ]{data-contrast="auto"}[work]{data-contrast="auto"}[.]{data-contrast="auto"} [T]{data-contrast="auto"}[he points/argument my writing is making is also more easily identifi]{data-contrast="auto"}[ed]{data-contrast="auto"}[ by the reader]{data-contrast="auto"}[ when it is correctly outlined as a short and precise]{data-contrast="auto"} [statement. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[I ]{data-contrast="auto"}[first became aware of thesis statements in ninth grade]{data-contrast="auto"}[. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[To pass an A.P. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[exam at the end of the year, it was]{data-contrast="auto"}[ necessary ]{data-contrast="auto"}[that]{data-contrast="auto"}[ we ]{data-contrast="auto"}[were]{data-contrast="auto"}[ proficient in the art of ]{data-contrast="auto"}[producing concise ]{data-contrast="auto"}[and terse ]{data-contrast="auto"}[thesis statements]{data-contrast="auto"}[, as our graders would]{data-contrast="auto"}[n't]{data-contrast="auto"}[ spend much time overlooking our essays.

I think that writing skills are very important to have in my everyday life, because I will write something everyday.

A thesis statement that is clear, yet detailed enough that the reader understands what the paper will look like is critical to forming a legitimate, sound argument. In an art history course, I had to write an extensive research paper explaining how Winslow Homer and Jackson Pollock modernized art in different forms at different periods. When I submitted my first draft to my professor, she enjoyed the details and path my paper took. However, my thesis statement needed to be refined, and she brought that to my attention. Luckily, she also added specific revision comments, letting me know details are central to a functional thesis statement. Upon receiving this feedback, I transformed a vague thesis into a focused statement. Immediately my paper became more logical. Since that moment, I focus on taking time to craft a balanced thesis statement that is supported by evidence. I love developing new writing skills because literacy is a powerful ability to possess. Writing, reading, speaking all tie into one larger skill set that allows one to convey thoughts and emotions to others. The power of literacy is important to me, and this is why I\'d like to improve my vocabulary through literature. Spending more time reading will provide exposure to words I haven\'t come across before. Some words have such a defined meaning that there are no replacements, and this will help me articulate my thoughts and feelings in enhanced detail to others.

What I mean by formality is I avoid using colloquial words or language in my writing. It is important to avoid slang or any terms that do not properly represent the subject you are talking about. In an essay I have recently written for my Secrets and Secret Codes class her at Geneseo we explored the power of Cryptography. My essay references the Navajo Code Talkers as well as Alan Turing and Enigma. Throughout my essay I discuss the importance of cryptography and to provoke thought from the reader I began my essay with the questions, "Is learning cryptography essential to maintaining our country\'s strongholds in the world? Is now the time to learn and teach about cryptography and its vast influence in history?" By using questions I believe I have drawn the reader in and made them draw their own conclusions and insight on the topic. By using more complex language as I did in this essay, you gain a sense of authority in writing and it only develops your writing more and more. The sentence," The power of an undiscovered language is insurmountable and is a jem that can be used in times of great need.", is a strong example of word use. The word choice makes the writing more intriguing to read and sounds much more appealing. At my high school it was a key teaching from many English teachers to shape our literary skills into formal and much more creative writing. These teachers shaped the writer I am today and even though I need assistance to grow as a writer, I have still come a long way in writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of the major aspects of writing that I need to grow in is learning punctuation and proper grammar. It is still unclear to me through my writing that I struggle to understand the way grammar and certain punctuation works. It is important to me to know how to write a powerful paper that is grammatically correct, especially because I want to be a teacher. It is something I have always struggled with and something that is in desperate need of change. When to use a semicolon versus a colon and how to set up dialogue in an essay as well as how to structure a sentence are all things I want to learn. I hope this course can help me achieve my goals of being a better writer.

Although the same points can be made with the language used in the initial versions of my writing, once they are already established, I attempt to make them clearer by eliminating unnecessary verbiage and details. During this process I consider each detail that I have included; if they do not coordinate with the other details in their paragraph and do not have a logical place anywhere else in the paper, I remove them. For example, rather than writing "Family life was her central focus, so she would not have used money to explore the possibilities of being a free woman, especially since societal standards placed so much importance on supporting one's family," I revised that sentence to be "Societal standards dictated that family life be her central focus, so she would have not used the money to explore the possibilities of being a free woman." Similarly, I removed the detail "the more wives a man had the better his reputation," and reworded it in a more comprehensive manner--- "\[wives\] are used to allow men to improve their reputations, like owning property." Although the former statement implied the latter statement, the former statement was underdeveloped and merely stated a trend from ]{data-contrast="auto"}[a ]{data-contrast="auto"}[single society, therefore it was irrelevant to my paper that explored the roles of women in more than just polygamous societies. In other words, the detail was more useful once it conveyed the more general idea that individual women, as wives, were used to bolster their husband's reputation. Through peer-editing and my teachers leaving comments on my papers, it has been brought to my attention when I write irrelevant things, which has further helped me improve my papers, as concision is important to convey ideas clearly. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [I would like to learn more persuasive writing technique]{data-contrast="auto"}[s, such as what type of supporting and opposing details I should include in my paper]{data-contrast="auto"}[.

This thesis is the basis of my whole essay, but how does one write a whole essay based on one sentence? In my AP English Language and Comprehension course in high school, we read a writing strategies book, They Say I Say, which introduced me to the concept of counterclaims. The thesis to one of my 11th grade essays was \"The use of nuclear weapons against Japan in the final days of world war two were unnecessary and inhuman.\" Now, instead of basing a whole argumentative piece on that one sentence, which would be tedious and repetitive, I will introduce a counterclaim to assess an opposing view point for my first body paragraph. For instance, \" An opposing claim, one that has been tossed around for decades, is that the use of atomic weaponry potentially saved hundreds of thousands of lives in preventing an invasion of mainland Japan.\" I then proceed to refute the counterclaim that I introduced, stating, \" this statement is false regarding the atomic bomb being necessary in ending the war, as the Japanese were already considering terms for their surrender. The US dropped the bomb instead to coerce the Japanese into an unconditional surrender, and to emerge as a new militaristic superpower. President Truman\'s own Chief of Staff , Adm. William Leahy, wrote "the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender....\". As can be seen, assessing and then discrediting a counterclaim adds perspective to my writing and thus strengthens my own argument. So rather than just stating a thesis and rambling on about it for paragraphs on end, my writing is more well thought out and credible. Going forward, I also wish to improve on blending outside evidence into my writing, to add an experts words to support my own argument whilst writing. I will introduce my own thoughts and then use an experts analysis to further my point, this will result in more convincing writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lila Brown ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write an essay, I like to focus on diction, phrasing, and format to get my views across. The words I use and how I put them together is important because it will tell a lot about me and how I communicate. The amount of variety in a writer's vocabulary can decide how a reader judges that writer. Based on their diction and use of correct grammar, do they sound educated and intelligent or illiterate and ignorant? Throughout a student's schooling, they are often told by their teachers that they must write or else they will fail the class. In high school, if I was unmotivated to write on the basis that I had to or else suffer a bad grade, my writing would not show what I truly had to say because it was not a topic that I cared to write about. This occurred multiple times when I had to write an essay on a book I didn't enjoy reading or a research topic I wasn't interested in learning more about. However, I eventually learned from my teachers and peers that it wasn't necessarily what I wrote about that made a good paper, it was how I went about writing it. One time in my AP Lang class, I had to write an essay on the play *Macbeth* by William Shakespeare. This was a challenge for me because I simply do not enjoy the difficultly of reading and understanding Shakespeare's plays. It was hard to grasp an understanding of the play, but from years of writing essays I have learned that incorporating good word choice, formatting my essay to have an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, and using correct grammar and phrasing can already help to achieve a grade that I will be satisfied with. I struggled with this growing up, but I can finally say that I have a grasp on how to write a good essay. One area I could improve upon is how to appreciate a topic of writing and deeply understand the purpose and meaning of it in order to add onto my writing skills and be able to confidently say what I have to say. To do this I believe that practicing active, engaging reading and annotating will help me step up my skills as a writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Shannon Brown =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write, my priority is to make sure everything is spelled correctly and grammatically correct. Focusing on this helps the reader understand what I am writing, and this way I do not have to worry about revising my writing as much. Many of my English teachers have been very focused on making sure students correct their spelling errors, so I have become more aware of the importance of doing so. My English teachers often told me that editing your writing and checking for errors makes the finished product seem more professional, and it will be easier for the reader to understand what you have written. However, if I see I have made a mistake while writing and stop to correct it, I often get distracted from the original point I was trying to convey to the reader. For example, in an email I wrote "it was very nice to speak with you today," and then got distracted and went on to immediately say "I would love to have this job." This phrase does not flow well when placed right after the first phrase. For this reason, my teachers advised me to write down my initial thoughts before revising anything I have written. I should have written down what I wanted to say before trying to edit my work. For example, I could have written a sentenced that transitioned the first phrase into the second phrase if I had not been distracted, such as "after hearing your thoughts and taking time to consider what you said, I have decided this job will be perfect for me." Also, if I'm in a quiet environment where I won't be easily distracted, it is much easier for me to learn. One aspect of writing that I hope to be able to improve upon is using fewer words to convey my ideas to the reader. I often make sentences longer than they need to be, which takes more time to and sometimes fails to show the reader the point I am trying to make. This is why I hope to learn how to find better ways to summarize my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cory Buff ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Cory Buff]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The skill I have learned from my past experiences is to focus on the so what question. This skill or habit of mine became locked into me during my late high school years. I was taught that the so what question means what it says. It means that with all of this information and facts that you have gathered, why do they matter, what\'s the point in all of this. This is an important skill to have because it illustrates or helps people reel in, put together, and explain all their facts and the meaning behind them. This skill first developed in me during a research paper I was writing. I had to collect all this information about my research subject, which was a painter during the Renaissance. Once I collected all of this information I tried to put it all together. I went to my teacher who read it and asked me, "So what?". This caused me to go back and re-examine the facts I collected. It took me a few tries, where every time I took it to my teacher he just repeated, "So what?", but in the end I managed to use the facts and information I had collected to explain the importance of the painter and why he mattered. This skill has definitely made me become a better writer in connecting the evidence I had and supporting it. To this day I still hold that teacher in high regards for getting that thought process in my mind.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I'd like to concentrate on my conclusion paragraphs. In the past I have had difficulties summarizing or re-stating my claims in a way where I don't sound like a broken record. Through the years I have had practice with conclusion paragraphs but there is still need for improvement. In order to improve, I should just practice writing conclusions and study templates for conclusions. The best practice with conclusions would be to actually write them in an essay I have to do and get feedback from my professor.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jayden Bulger =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Jayden Bulger\ 9/10/19 I take pride in my academic writing especially the sentence structure and word-choice I try to incorporate into a piece. During my senior year at high school my teacher for my tenth grade english course made it very clear to the class and I to keep the reader engaged. It's very easy for the reader to get bored and lose interest in the writing if all you do is use the same word choice and sentence structure. He made it clear especially in introducing sources and outside sources to vary the introduction. Examples such as "The author stated" and then later in the essay twice more repeated "The author said" made it very easy for him to point out. It was then when I started to put more thought into the sentence structure. The audience should be constantly flooded with new words and not the same old adjectives or verbs. Along with different introductions to outside sources he also made a point to really make sure we are varying sentence length, to again make the reader more engaged and less bored. He made it clear in my first essay when I made every sentence flow the same and basically had the same number of words, he said varying sentence structure needs to vary, in bold, ALOT.\ Moving forward into Geneseo and into my own writing, I plan on focusing more and more on sentence structure. My high school teacher always wanted me to focus on that because sentence structure gives the framework for the entire piece, and if all the sentences are the same it makes it very boring and easy to lose track for the reader. It's imperative that I continue working on differing sentences, such as sentence length, sentence diction and even flow of sentences in order to further my success in writing.\ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicholas Buonaiuto ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing essays in the past, I focus my draft revisions on making my language as clear as possible. It is important for me to read over my writing and make changes to wording that is not straight forward enough. When I write essays they start long, with lots of extraneous information that gets cut out in the draft process. Making sure that the whole essay flows in one clear direction and doesn\'t jump around too much is what I work on most in writings. An example of simple rewording to help clean up one of my writing assignments is in my original essay on college athletics, I wrote "If they still must pay for books and do extra work they should make something on top of that also.". This was not the best way to describe my view of the topic and sounds out of place. Through feedback from my teacher I decided a better way to phrase the message was "The deals student athletes take are often focused too heavily on the athletics, making it hard for them to put work into school.". Changing how I brought up the same thing made it much clearer to the reader what the essay will try to prove. Now that I\'m in college, my writing must get up to the next level. The skill I feel can improve my writing most at Geneseo will be learning to understand and incorporate sources from new places, and increase the substance of my writing. High school writing is mostly opinion based and I am not used to having to do research for a writing assignment. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Carly Burgio ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One issue I encounter in my academic writing is my tendency to write in the passive voice. I never realized that it was a problem until my tenth grade English teacher pointed it out in a number of my essays. For a long time, including the duration of that class and for a while afterwards, I struggled with the concept of writing in the active voice because I didn't understand why it made a difference to write in the active voice instead of the passive voice. However, being concise with my writing was also a problem in the past, so I understand that writing in the active voice helps condense what I want to say, and it ends up making more sense in the process. As I continue to understand the importance of active voice in academic writing, I consciously seek to revise cases of the passive voice in my writing. When I do these revisions, my grammar tends to improve overall, which is beneficial for my future as a student and as an educator. Recently, in a written response for my English class, I revised the sentence, "In early history, the only work that had been accepted as literature were biblical texts and sacred scriptures." I changed "The only works that]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ***had been*** [accepted as literature were...," which is in the passive voice, to "The only work]{style="font-weight: 400;"}***s***[ accepted as literature were...," which is the active voice. It makes the sentence less confusing, more grammatically sound, and more concise. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I further my education and academic writing at Geneseo, I anticipate and look forward to learning new skills. I believe that humans improve through knowledge and education, so I hope to build myself as a person as I build my skills. In regards to writing, I know that I need to develop better skills for including evidence without taking quotes from articles or books word for word. In my high school academic papers that revolved around a certain piece, I struggled to paraphrase because I was afraid it would be considered plagiarism. I hope that I can learn this skill and strike a balance when I use textual evidence. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ava Byroads ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One of the criticisms of my writing is that I tend to have a flowery style. Teachers and peers alike found my work complex, when a simpler explanation would have sufficed. I get carried away in descriptions and use synonyms of a common word, trying to make my writing sound more intelligent. I am aware that my method does not really work, given that using bigger words in place of a conventional, smaller word makes my papers convoluted and cluttered. However, I recognize that being ornate is not always a downside to writing. In fact, it can provide the reader with interest into the subject being discussed, and displays the capabilities of a writer, when done correctly. In a personal letter of mine, I struggled in how I should speak to my estranged father. This is a letter I thought of as formal, due to its awkward nature of trying to reinvigorate our relationship. I overthought the majority of what I wanted to tell him, and I did not want to come across as inordinately formal. For instance, I was discussing my future in college, \"In that time, I will most likely participate in a variety of internships and possibly assist in some sort of research, or so I've been promised by their enticing pamphlets and discussions as to what happens in their psychology program. \" I felt unsure about this sentence, because looked like a run-on sentence, and it seemed excessively wordy. So, I consulted my mother, who is an editor. She agreed with what I had assumed was wrong with the sentence, and recommended that I simplify it. Therefore, I would sound more natural and heartfelt while still being formal, \"While I\'m in college, I would like to participate in internships and be involved in some sort of research on campus. I've been enticed by what Geneseo\'s psychology program has to offer.\" Though significantly shorter, I explained my plans without being overly flowery. In the future, I\'d like to continue suppressing this habit. College writing involves a combination of sentences that do not always have to be prolonged, and a point can be made concisely. I rely too much on my doubts in that making a sentence shorter must mean that I am not formulating my argument well. The opposite is true, and I would like to continue to relinquish the urge to overwrite. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Austin Cairns =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Austin Cairns [In my writing one of the key elements that I have been trying to focus on in recent years is making it more concise and to the point, with less filler than in the past. From middle school until eleventh grade I would write essays that satisfied the prompt but looked more full than they were due to lots of "fluff" in the writing. I used to think that having a longer essay than people would mean that it was a better one, I was very wrong about this. My grades weren't as good as I wanted them to be on the writing assignments and every time it was because they were too padded with filling and not directly to the point enough. My teacher, Mr. Gillet, was very good about helping me learn how to cut out the unnecessary information or turn it into necessary and interesting information that progresses the essay, not just increase the length of it. For instance, I had to write a paper in his class on the film]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ Koyaanisqatsi ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[which, in all honesty, was largely filler. The film has no speaking and most of my essay was summarizing the images I saw, with only very small sections focused on what the meaning of the images were or what the director's intent was. He helped me cut down my essay by about 200 words and make it more specifically about the messages, not necessarily making the essay look "pretty" or full of information like my past writings were. I took it from, "One of the 'chapters' of ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Koyaanisqatsi]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ shows many images of cities compared to computer chip like structures, cutting back and forth between the two, showing the advancements of humanity in technology" to, "Mans removal from nature is displayed with the stark contrast of previous shots of landscapes and a world untouched by humanity, to one where our very civilizations have begun to look like the technology that we have created." My statement satisfied the prompt and had more direct information than it would've with the "filler" and lack of real analysis.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future I would like to improve my writing of introduction and conclusion paragraphs. Despite having rubrics in the past and satisfying what is needed out of introductions and conclusions with very few points off, I personally never feel satisfied or that my conclusions and introductions are truly as good as they could be.

I use this to start my writing pieces off strong with a clear view of what the paper will be about as well as catching the reader's attention. Since middle school humanities my teachers would emphasis the importance of having a good thesis. It wasn't until I took AP World History that my teacher drilled the concept of having a detailed thesis into my mind, causing me to be conscious of whether my thesis is an accurate representation of the entire essay or not. I would rewrite the thesis for an essay numerous times, sometimes writing the claim first then after writing the paper revising it to fit a central theme. Although I had obtained the skill of writing solid claims during my senior year my Participation in Government teacher emphasized the importance of hooks to capture the audience's attention. An example of a poor introductory sentence I wrote once is " Violence is everywhere in Central American countries, making it dangerous for children to live there". After revising that hook I came up with "The sound of gunshots, staying in your house while its dark, violence, oppression, and fear have all become a normalized part of daily life for those in Central American countries." That claim is much more intriguing to an audience than the first one. Through my semester in this class I began to think outside of the box to write interesting hooks along with my initial skill of writing strong thesis'.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [After careful consideration I would like to improve my writing skills at my time at Geneseo and for the future in the aspect of research and work citation. I tend to notice that I struggle to correctly cite my work. My junior year of high school I wrote an eighteen page research paper and found myself struggling to decipher what kind of information is common knowledge versus information that must be cited. I also feel as though I have confusion as to when I should use quotations or when to parenthetically cite. In order to improve upon this skill I plan to use the library resources to my advantage and ask for help when I am unsure about matters of citations in order to prevent plagiarism.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jennifer Cappock ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout high school, I struggled with repeating myself in my writing. It was very hard for me to see which ideas were useful or not in my work. I would add information just to make my essays longer or reach the word requirement. Each essay that I then received back had lines through sentences meaning they didn\'t need to be there. After asking my teachers for help, they told me I should start reading my writing aloud to myself to see if it sounds correct. This helped a tremendous amount. I then began to see a huge improvement in my writing and the grades I was being presented with. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Writing has been a challenge for me in the past. When practicing for the essay component of the SAT, I never realized any of the mistakes I was making. I took many classes on how to write an essay, but the teachers never read our writing. I then had to get a tutor who helped me a great amount. She helped me correct my writing telling me that you do not need to have a long essay to get your point through. Going on and on in your essays and repeating yourself just makes your work unnecessarily longer when the key ideas were already said. It also causes the reader to not have an interest in writing. I then saw automatic results going forward. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [For the future, here at Geneseo, I would like to improve on more things. I think that my writing can always be improved upon.

It would also sound more appealing to the reader. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ryan Carberry =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing I focus on consistently as I go through revisions is how the information in my writing relates back to the thesis. This aspect is important because if the information in an essay seems off-topic from the thesis, the reader might get confused or even disinterested in the subject. And more importantly, they won't understand the point of my essay. My 12th grade Creative Writing teacher, Mrs. Zlotnik, drilled this idea into me. For example, in my college essay, my thesis was that "patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish" -- a quote from John Quincy Adams. The essay was about my academic struggles that began in elementary school and how, in some instances, I overcame them and, in other instances, I learned to compensate for them. In my early drafts, I found myself rambling a lot, writing about my journey and often going off on tangents with many stories where I felt bad about what made me different and many reasons for how I overcame my disabilities. But as I reviewed it and refined it with the help of others, I was able to focus on one significant factor that was life changing for me. When I realized the significance of joining a swim team and fully committing to the diet and exercise it takes to excel at sports, I realized it was that important change in my life that helped me to bring that same discipline and focus to my school work. That's why the moment I get handed a writing assignment, I always begin with an outline that starts with a thesis and then connects the thesis to ideas. I brainstorm ideas that strongly connect to each other while I type away. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I'd like to focus more on getting other people to peer review my writing. In the past, I always felt my ideas were the best and I was too stubborn to get help for my writing, even if my parents and teachers strongly recommended it. If I get more people to read my writing, I can get constructive criticism for my writing and perfect my writing skills to make myself a better writer overall.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mikayla Carney ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Mikayla Carney\ Dr. Paku\ INTD 106: Conventions of College Writing\ August 30th 2019\ Self-Reflection\ When I take on a writing assignment my strongest aspect comes from backing up information with solid, cohesive evidence /elaboration. I was drilled with essay structures that emphasized when writing a statement follows credible sources; that evidence must also come citable. The reason for my strong attention to fill my writing with evidence/elaboration is so my writing doesn't become questionable. First I pick through my sources to find reliable facts to refer to instead of stating my main points and then searching for evidence that is supportive. During graphic novels senior year, we had the task to describe internal conflicts within the text from two different perspectives. Not only do I give location of my evidence but I also describe the illustrations to give my reader a better understanding, "Anya's internal conflict between Sean and Elizabeth is on page 122-123 and to Anya she starts off very confused when she hears Sean's behind the bathroom door when Elizabeth is in front of the door." I go on to talk about body language and facial expressions being more powerful than dialogue, " Up until that point Anya's arms stay crossed on her body and the illustrators choice to do this creates the feeling of Anya need to create a barrier between her and Sean because of how uncomfortable and upset she is with the situation. Until the last tier comes into play and Anya is no longer showing facial expressions\..."\ In the future I hope to grow a better understanding of the more complex punctuation and vocabulary, which I believe this course will push me towards reaching. I was not in the honors or AP English classes and this is where all my peers have the skills I lack and are strong writers; my English classes all 3 years were heavily centered around reading comprehension. This only set me up for making it through high school English and unlike the excelled course they learned to become a better writer. During senior year I took electives from the AP teachers and learned more that's prepared me for college, but only from failure; my most frequent correction would be "bad grammar". I have been working hard to catch up to the level of my peers in that aspect and can see I'm making an improvement.

I've often done this by writing about deeply personal experiences and trying to pull out an emotion in my reader that they can relate to. However, It has been brought to my attention that I don\'t always do this in a way that preserves the sophistication of my writing as well as allows the reader to come to their own conclusion about my thoughts. Instead of using broad and general terms such as "one" or "a person" I've reduced myself and my writing to using the term "you". I specifically remember writing a deeply emotional literacy narrative in my senior year of high school. I wrote about how bullet journaling helped me become emotionally transparent in my writing as well as my life. I remember writing about how I felt after after making a list that was clear and concise. Instead of writing from a first person perspective I wrote a sentence something like "You can see all of your thoughts and feelings on the page.", and many more sentences akin to that. Because of this alone, my teacher gave me a 90 on my narrative. Now thinking back, my choice of words doesn't make the reader want to resonate with my writing, it could possibly make a reader feel like they are being forced to feel something that they don't. This is completely disingenuous and the opposite of my goal as a writer. In my future academic writing I want to make my reader feel a natural pull to my thoughts and feelings and recognize how it may resonate with them, all while allowing my writing to remain professional.

Doing this, I know exactly what I'm writing about and I don't have to question and explain what everything in the text means. I have never been good at summarizing quotes or following them with relevant information. My junior year English teacher taught be that a minimum of 80% of my writing should be my own words with a maximum of 20% being quoted writings. When I write, my technique is to first, write everything I want to out in the text, that is my own words and information, down in quick sentences that make sense to me. In my last essay I wrote for my English class in twelfth grade, which was a paper I chose to be on domestic violence, I wrote various things I already knew down such as, "More women are domestic violence victims than men." With this being a research paper, there were more quotes in it than there would be if I was writing an essay about a book I had read, but the same process was relevant for both. After writing everything I wanted in my essay down that was my own words, I went through and looked at the sentences I had less information on such as, "Kids who witness domestic violence in their homes are affected immensely," and I would look for research about that particular subject. This way, I was sticking to the original plan, but also providing information I was lacking about the subject, "Children are more likely to develop physical and mental problems as an adult if they witnessed or have been a victim of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse (depression, anxiety, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, low self-esteem, etc.) as when they are young, they are extremely vulnerable." In the future, I would like to concentrate more on my conclusions. This may not be very specific but in my high school, I was never taught how to write a proper conclusion. My teachers would write comments on my conclusions saying what I did wrong, but they never taught me how to fix it. I'm very unsure of what I am supposed to write about in my conclusions and I would like to become confident whenever I write a conclusion to any piece of my writing, possibly by learning more on my own and reading other works to see how the conclusions were written. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sophia Catalina ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing, I focus on making a strong point with each sentence and paragraph. When I address equally weighted topics or phrases, the essay becomes too saturated and boring. This is why I make sure to spread them out through the work. I used to have a problem with this, as I wanted to make sure that my points in the essay were made extra clear within each sentence and paragraph, but my English teacher senior year helped me with this challenge. I minimized what I had to say in each paragraph, so naturally, unnecessary and repeating thoughts were eliminated. An example would be \"The atmosphere in the house was always tense and I was confused and a bit angry at the family member for treating someone they loved in that way. After several years, I finally understood why they would backlash and get triggered by them.\". After revision, I changed the last sentence to \"After several years, I finally understood the reason behind their actions.\" because I had already explained those actions before. Even if I make the essay less wordy, I make sure that I get my point across. Going forward, I\'d like to focus on making my essays even more precise and to the point. I will do this by brainstorming all of my ideas first and then start writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joel Cavanagh =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} The main goal that I consciously focus on achieving in my writing is getting my ideas across concisely and succinctly without sacrificing meaning. It\'s a tricky balance to find since writing too much or too little can have the same effect; in that, both can result in a tough read. My AP Literature assigned my class a weekly exercise; in which, each student was to free-write for five minutes about a topic of their choosing, and then take another two minutes to cut their word count in half. In a chemistry lab, previous to my exposure to this exercise, I wrote \"It is clear from the results of the experiment where Ernest Rutherford shot a beam of alpha particles at a strip of gold foil, and the particles made it through, that atoms are mostly empty space\". Now I can rewrite this as \"The results of Rutherford\'s alpha particle and gold foil experiment clearly show that atoms are mostly empty space\" while retaining the same meaning. \ During my time at Geneseo and beyond, I\'d like to put more focus on my use of semicolons. Perhaps I should try paying more attention to the structure of what I read to learn more about them. I oftentimes find myself writing sentences that I know should have a semicolon, but I lack the confidence to use them, or I\'ll use them and have them misplaced.

I try to have a conversation with my reader, however one-sided it may be. This observation was first drawn by my freshman English teacher, who was then expressing her frustration with me because, while conversational writing was one of my strengths, work ethic and time management were not.

It would do me well to practice forming a well-paced discourse, perhaps by identifying my main points, mapping them out, then filling in the gaps with carefully crafted, delicious "fluff."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Cerrato ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Matthew Cerrato Throughout high school I have written many papers. Papers where I would go off on tangents and always get points taken off. Talking to my past English teachers had helped me, but I still seemed to make the same mistake time and time again. Going to extra help, like office hours here at SUNY Geneseo constantly trying to fix my repetition issue as well. Whatever issues I had just like the two I just mentioned I would always seek help. One of my old high school teachers once told me and my class that he thought he was the best writer in the world when he came out of high school and when he went he got to college he learned real fast that what he thought wasn't the truth. Those issues over the course of four years have been suppressed and I write much better than I did. It's so hard to talk about just one paper, because there are so many where I have spewed meaningless and repetitive words on a piece of paper. Why only talk about some of my papers when all of them tell the true story. When all those papers show my progression, my movement towards being a better writer and not repeating sentences and rambling on about something completely off topic. One area I seek to develop is my grammar, like proper punctuation and knowing all the literary devices and not just some. The two things I seek to contain or to not see much of is my repetition and tangent issue when writing papers, especially in college. Knowing when to use certain punctuation marks and knowing the definitions to all the literary devices is important when wanting to become an exceptional writer. Taking this course is important, because it will allow me to continue to grow in the world of writing, or English for that matter. We speak it (English) everyday, so why not take the time to truly learn the language. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Justin Chan ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [All my life, writing has been extremely difficult to me compared to other subjects such as math and science. As I continue to develop my reading and writing skills, I have realized that I focus more on developing a strong introductory paragraph. Having a strong introduction is important to all essays because it gives readers insight on the information/argument that is to come later in the essay. In addition, it can give readers interest in the topic which can influence them to continue reading in certain types of essays. I believe that I can create a strong introduction paragraph when I write because of the way my english teacher in 11th grade taught me. She made us follow a certain template that explicitly tells the readers the right amount of information while keeping it interesting and telling my main point of writing the essay to readers.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I feel that the hardest part about writing for me is being able to sound more sophisticated while trying to stay on track with my main point. I tend to go off track on my thoughts and then somehow bring it back to the main point which is not a good habit since it tends to confuse readers. Meanwhile, trying to sound sophisticated to readers is difficult since it needs to be incorporated throughout the writing instead of just changing a word like "happy" to "elated." Furthermore, in order to bring my writing skills to a college level, I need to also be able to increase my critical thinking skills and provide a better analytical interpretation with quotes to further prove my main point in the essay. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Macy Chapman ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Macy Chapman ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I tend to focus on using examples and evidence to confirm the points and statements I make in my writing because that is how to prove that the information I share to the reader is reliable and accurate. Whenever, I state a fact or piece of information about the topic I am discussing, I confirm it with evidence founded before writing my essay. My previous english teachers taught me this technique with demonstrations and templates. At first, I struggled with using this technique until teachers constantly corrected me and showed me how to properly use it in order to make my writing stronger. For example, in one of my written works I stated that "the Westboro Baptist Church spends most of their time protesting and expressing their hateful opinions". I supported this statement by saying, "the church has participated in over 41,000 protests in over 650 cities\" and "they travel across the whole country to picket the funerals of homosexual victims to spread hateful words and make a mock of their lives and families". Furthermore, I stated how the "Westboro Baptist Church blames the acceptance of homosexuality for horrible acts of violence in our nation" followed by the evidence that "they believe terrorist attacks like 9/11 and the Boston Marathon was God punishing America for accepting gay marriage". This writing technique is vital since it makes my writing stronger and trustworthy. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I wish to develop my grammar skills. I never know when I should or should not use commas and other punctuation. Additionally, I struggle with run on sentences, sentence fragments, independent clauses, and dependent clauses. I also would like to become better with my sentence structure to make my writing flow better. I wish to become more accurate and comfortable using proper grammar because it is an important part of having a well written essay. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Bryan Chavez ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When revising my writing I tend to focus more on the clarity of my piece. I read over the words that I use to help me determine whether or not what I\'m writing appeals to the person reading my piece. If I feel like what I'm writing in my piece does not hint out who or what I'm writing about, I go back and add a few more sentences just to specify. When writing a piece, I want the reader to know exactly what the subject is. During my AOP summer program, I had written a research paper on immigration and the effects that it has on the infrastructure of the United States. Before submitting my paper my professor had read it over and pointed out a line that I said about immigrants. In my paper I wrote, "To those who come to America looking for job opportunities, seeking employment is the solution to their struggles." After reading that line my professor had asked me "Who are you referring to when you say \'\'those \`\`or \'\'them \`\`. This question that I had been asked made me reflect on the clarity of my piece. From then on I made sure that my piece was clear on who I was talking about, in this case, the subject of my piece was immigrants. I went back and made the subject clear by changing what I had written to say "To those immigrants who come to America looking for job opportunities, seeking employment is the solution to their struggles. Furthermore, the addition of the word "immigrants" made it clear to who I was writing about when I used the word "their". Aside from clarity as an issue, what I need to work on is keeping it simple and explaining terms at my own pace. When writing in the past, I would assume that the reader already had an idea of whatever I chose to write about. What I know now is that it\'s better to appeal to the reader as if you were teaching them. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rachel Cheeseman ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on not being repetitive in my writing. I often, when creating a claim, rewrite it in other words or sentences that mean the same thing. Not doing so makes the reader feel off-put and they may discontinue reading if they feel the sense of boredom. Repeating the same thing over and over can get old quick and feel dawning for the reader and writer. Yes, it may be easier to take the short-cut to copy and paste your statement but taking the extra two minutes and being prepared ahead of time with a differently worded statement can save you frustration when writing, especially when writing based on a template. My ninth and eleventh-grade teachers were the ones who taught me this and it always stuck with me to plan-ahead this way. An example of this writing skill was when I was writing a paper my senior year based on a book we read. My original thesis/ main idea in my introduction was, "Jackson demonstrates, through the use of identity and society, that living in seclusion raises more questions and concerns in the community around them." For my re-worded statement, to be used in a different paragraph I wrote, "The idea that isolation leads to curiosities from the outside world is supported in chapter two when Helen Clark and Mrs. Wright went to the Blackwood house for tea." When I read aloud through the material I have written, I see if these statements are as clear as can be and connect the way they should so I'm not making separate claims that would confuse the reader. Going forward, I do need to be more confident in explaining my evidence throughout my writing. I am usually able to fill out the introduction to each paragraph and give examples, but I don't do as good of a job as I can at explanations. I hope I take more time to do those revisions like that, so I don't hand in a paper that seems unfinished.

A lot of the times, I put too much information in my thesis that it becomes overcomplicated, therefore confusing to the reader. An organized thesis statement sets the reader up for the rest of the essay. It would also allow me, the writer to have a clear direction of what topic sentences and ideas I should include in each of my body paragraphs. I have to always remind myself of what I learned from Professor Belyakov's Writing 101/201 class that, a thesis statement should consist of my position to the topic and the developmental links or reasonings that support it. An example of one of my messy thesis statements is that " Goodwin is a hard worker, therefore, she should not feel ashamed nor be penalized for a human error." Now when I look back at this old thesis, I do not actually remember what I was writing about at the time. I was being too vague because the two parts do not seem to connect to each other. However when I jumped to the revised thesis, "Goodwin has put every effort into citing for her book and she is also a mother on the side, therefore, she should not feel ashamed nor be penalized for a human error such as missing a citation," it made more sense to me. I can conclude using the thesis that, Goodwin is a hardworking writer and a mother on the side, therefore, it is possible for her to accidentally commit plagiarism. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [To move forward, I have a lot more writing skills that I have to practice, such as grammar and punctuation, avoid informal writing, write concisely and etc. I especially overwrite a lot of the times when I can write less to express my ideas. For example, "An organized thesis statement is crucial to set the reader up for the rest of the essay," whereas, I can simply have it as, "An organized thesis statement sets the reader up for the rest of the essay." Professor Belyakov would always say that a word is a dollar and you want to save as much money as possible. It is a helpful way to keep me in check.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jahnia Cherenfant =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing I consciously try to focus on is providing credible examples and evidence to back up my claims. This skill is important because anyone can just write about anything but without proof or actual examples to help strengthen your argument, your argument can be become inaccurate, irrelevant, and redundant. For instance, people who throw around loose claims, and statistics are often getting their information from unreliable and inaccurate sources, so if you provide actual evidence to back your claims and it's a credible source than that makes a stronger argument. I believe finding credible sources and good examples helps readers better understand your writing and thought processing, everyone is different so examples and evidence can help our writing seem less complex and provides the context of your writing with more clarity. When I began to take more academically challenging courses in high school, I noticed that we were only instructed to use academic articles and accredited information. My High School Government & Social Economics teacher Mrs. Hibdon (nickname: Hibby) used to always give us lists of credible outlets to find our sources. I used to bug her by asking her to accept articles I found from non credible websites, she always told me she could either give me no points or one point when most of the sources she required us to have were usually 3-4 points, each assignment we had to have about 12-15 points of sources incorporated into our essays and projects. I realized as time went on that it was easier to do annotated bibliographies with more credible sources, they provided more information, facts, arguments and overall more quality content. I realized that the less credible sources often times had flaws and incorrect information that did not match up with my more credible sources. Using the less credible sources turned out to be useless when I realized that wouldn't help strengthen my argument, instead others could use it against me possibly and call me out for using incorrect information. So, I began to sincerely see the importance of credible evidence and examples. My experience in high school helped me when I first came to college. I had an idea of how to write academic essays, citing sources in APA and MLA, bibliographies, annotated bibliographies, finding sources, revising my essays, using peer revision, going to Liberians to help me find good sources. My transition into college didn\'t feel so daunting to me, just handling the work load was a bit difficult to adjust to. One aspect I am developing in my writing is being clearer and more concise. I think it is easy to write run on sentences and just let my thought processing out into words. I took a creative writing class last semester, we often would have workshops and critique each others writing and through hearing people\'s opinions on my work as well as my professors input, I was able to improve my writing by revising my work based on their advice. I think it is important to edit and evaluate my writing to be clearer and essentially palatable for people to read. I personally dislike reading lengthy things that take forever to get to the point, yet I often do the same thing. So, I'm always consciously trying to minimize my sentences and replace them for more impact words. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Elena Cheung ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The aspect of writing that I focus the most on is conveying a clear sense of purpose. Whether that is writing to persuade or to inform, my goal is to show the reader why I care about the topic, and why they should too. Often times, when people are given readings in class, they wonder why they are required to read that material. Conveying a clear sense of purpose in my writing will grasp the reader's attention, and consider my point of view. In order to convey purpose in my writing, it is important that I establish a sense of tone, which will reveal my attitude towards the topic that I am writing about. When writing a scholarship essay, I had to describe my past running experience, my academic and extracurricular achievements, and my plans for running beyond high school. An example of how I did not develop a clear sense of purpose in the essay was when I listed off my achievements and plans like "I committed to running in my sophomore year of high school, I took mostly advanced placement and honors classes, and I was an officer of two clubs." When I gave my essay to my twelfth grade English teacher to read, she asked me, "so what?" That was when I realized that the point of the scholarship essay was to prove why I was a worthy candidate for the \$1,000 prize, and without explaining the significance of how running and my other commitments affected my life, I had failed to prove my point. When revising my essay, I specified how running was connected to other aspects of my life: "The combination of attending a mental wellness club and running not only improved my mental wellness, but also my academic performance and time management skills." Developing the skill of conveying purpose has helped my writing become effective, and has given me confidence in my own writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward, I'd like to develop a strategy before I start writing. Sometimes, when I am given a prompt, I jump to answer the prompt by merely stating facts rather than planning out how those facts will support the point of my writing. I will ask myself what I am trying to accomplish, which will give me a direction to go in. Then, I will identify my audience, which determines my tone, which may be either formal or informal.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Choi ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Grace Choi Professor Paku Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities 9/5/19 Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities When writing any assignment, I put my focus on organizing and composing my thoughts in well-written paragraphs that allow the readers to clearly understand the message I want to convey. If thoughts and ideas are not organized in an essay it can confuse and distract the reader. Sometimes, I would talk about one topic, start introducing another and go back and forth between both topics. While writing my college admissions essay, I initially wrote, "Initially, I was embarrassed whenever I saw my dad in that blue vest because I thought the outfit symbolized his inferiority to other dads I saw. I also hated being home alone and I never liked the fact my family members never stuck around." I introduced the idea of being embarrassed by my dad's outfit then continued to talk about how I hated being home alone. One person who pointed out my faults in this writing was one of my high school English teachers, and she informed me how I should have expanded on why I would be embarrassed and introduce how I would hate being alone in a separate paragraph, discussing a new topic. In the revised version of my essay, I put an effort in to not be vague with anything I would introduce and made sure the thoughts would flow in a way that the readers would have an easy time reading. In the future, I would like to improve on writing in well thought out paragraphs that discuss relevant topics in each separate paragraph. I would also like to use higher-level vocabulary in all my writing to reflect college-level writing skills. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Victoria Chow =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In writing and revising drafts I focus on spelling errors because I noticed when I read out loud, word for word I find tiny spelling mistakes. Back in elementary school I was so hard on myself during spelling quizzes. If I got a word wrong my teacher will tell me to spell the word out loud and constantly practice writing it until I get it in my head. If there are many miss spelled or miss used vocabulary the writing will be confusing and hard to understand, also interpreted in the wrong way. In my recent research paper about vaccines a paragraph started with "Over the decade various vaccines were created to help stop the spread of disease" the use of the word decade is not accurate because vaccines were made over the span of 10 years which makes it misleading information. So the change would be "Over the century's various vaccines were created to help stop the spread of disease" this gives the reader the accurate information about the topic. This skill is helpful for me to clearly present the main idea in my writing with the proper spelling and word choice. The area that I want to develop in is creating a well-organized thesis statement. Having a strong thesis I important in writing because it helps show why the essay is important and worth reading. I may be lacking knowledge of a topic I am writing about which makes my thesis weak. So possibly I can do more research on a topic to gain more understanding before stating a thesis. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lacy Ciccarelli ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write something one of the things I focus on is the flow of the piece. The flow of the story is very important because it keeps the reader engaged. Small spelling mistakes and words/phrases that are not where they should be can trip up a reader and confuse them. In my middle/high school I received lots of support when refining my work. What we were taught was to read it out loud and see how it sounded. After that the teacher would then take a look at it with us and help edit it more. Reading aloud helps me with the flow because I get a sense of how it sounds. Knowing how it sounds is important because you want it to make sense. In the first draft of an essay I did titled Best Buddies (based on the organization), I wrote "The Best Buddies walk is for raising awareness and funds to support individuals with IDD's. The donations for the walk go to the Best Buddies to help support their program." Though in my second draft I added in "The specialness of it is that a lot of people are coming together for a common cause" to help reinforce the idea that there is something special about it. When trying to make a case in something like an argumentative essay you often find many parts of someone's argument you want to use but have trouble paraphrasing enough. Since this sometimes describes me, from this point on I want to work on developing my paraphrasing skills. Even though I'm ok at it I often struggle with paraphrasing it to where I'm not plagiarizing. When writing essays, I will go to the college writing center for help and in turn develop my skills. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Giovanni Cicoria-Timm =================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Giovanni Cicoria-Timm]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [11 September 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I believe that one aspect of writing I already do a fine job with is structure. Whether I am writing an essay, poem or even a short story, I believe that structure is key in creating a stellar piece of work. The structure, can arguably be the most important element of writing. For example, a writer could have all the facts in their paper but in no true order and without order, the paper may even struggle to make sense. My teachers throughout my middle and high school career really pushed structure in writing and I did my best to implement the skill of writing with structure into my own repertoire. Many times throughout high school we would write essays based off of a short passage we read. While writing the body paragraphs for these essays, first, I would start off with coming up with a solid topic sentence for my paper. Next I would make sure to find a quote that supports my thesis and what I'm trying to prove to the audience. Then after that, I would always make sure to explain the quote to help the reader understand how the quote relates to the point I'm trying to get across to the audience. Once I believe that the audience has a firm grasp of how the quote relates to the paper as a whole, I will create a concluding sentence that either leads into the next body paragraph or the concluding paragraph. Every time I write, I think about these steps in my attempt to create the best piece of work possible. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I can definitely look back and see how far I have come as a writer but I can definitely look forward as well and see that there is also however, much room for growth. One thing that I truly believe would enhance my writing abilities would be coming up with more new ways to engage the reader, especially in the introduction paragraph. From past experience, creating an exciting 'hook' towards the beginning of my papers has been rough and sometimes even frustrating at times. I would love to figure out more ways to draw the reader's attention because once I get past that, I feel like I could write for hours. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Janine Clancy =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One thing I focus on consciously is my structure. Since middle school I was always taught different ways to layout essays and paragraphs. In early middle school it was the hamburger method and as we got into late middle school and early high school it transitioned to the BOYS, TEES and OYS methods. This made writing a little bit easier for me because it was like following a formula, something I am very comfortable doing. The first paragraph I would use BOYS: Broad statement about the topic, opposing statement, your thesis and site what source you would be using. Then for the body paragraphs I would use TEES: Thesis, explanation one, explanation two (you could do more than two), and then summarize what you wrote. To conclude the essay I would use OYS: the opposing side, your thesis, and then summarize. We would do these methods for our yearly research paper and frequent argumentative essays. Also we would use just TEES for basic short essays that we would also do in class. They drilled this into us for my many years of schooling and it really stuck with me so I am conscious of it every time I write. Especially because I am not the best writer it helps me keep cohesion in my papers. In my most recent essay I used the BOYS method. \"From Big Bootie remixes to The Starving Games, remixes can be seen in many different forms\", this is my broad opening statement. \"Who would have a problem with these remixes?\", this is like my opposing statement. Lastly my thesis and statement of my main source can be seen with the quote \" As seen in the film "RIP! A Remixers Manifesto," copyright laws have changed over time due to remixes. Over the years, copyright laws have become more strict than they have been in the past, they make lawsuits more common and make it harder to justify fair use. This has caused a restriction on creativity and in turn made our future less free.\"]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue my writing career, I would love to improve many writing skills. The concept I would like to work on the most is forming a strong thesis. I struggle a little on choosing a topic as well as finding evidence to support it. When writing an essay my points bounce around to try and get them to match my thesis and my paper ends up not making sense because of it. If I am able to form a strong thesis I feel I will be able to find supporting points easier as well and just improve my writing all around.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Megan Clancy ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Megan Clancy INTD 106 Self-Reflection \#1 As I write and revise my own works, I tend to focus on a strong opening and closing sentence. What I mean by that is that I tend to make sure that the first sentence of an essay really grabs the reader's attention. Then, I make sure that the reader is left with a thought-provoking, impressive sentence with the closing. My English teacher in eleventh grade taught me that the first sentence of an essay (a "hook," as he called it) should be a fact, a quote, a statistic, a definition, or just an impressive starter. I always listened to what he taught me, through twelfth grade and beyond. One example of my own writing is that, when I had to write an essay on a quote and relate it to *The Great Gatsby*, I started with, "Love is an emotion that everyone longs to have present in their everyday life." I believe that that sentence was a good hook because it draws the reader in as to what I, the author, was getting into. Another example of my own writing that I focused on the closing sentences was when I had to write an essay about education and ideas of how to reform the education system. My closing sentences were about what I, as a student in high school, should be told in the education system: "I should be told that my best is good enough. But I am not." I used a series of sentences just like these to prove my final points about how the education system should be fixed for the future. As I write, I focus on making my first and final sentences as strong as possible. As I write my own works, I need to work on how I use my resources in essays. My English teacher in the eleventh grade told me that I should use the sources in a way where my voice can still be heard in the work, and to not let the sources use me. I tend to just use sources in essays and just explain the source the way it was analyzed in class, rather than finding my own way and own words to explain it, I just use what I was told. I need to focus more on finding my own voice in essays that have sources involved. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Melanie Clancy ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on eliminating run-on sentences when drafting my own writing. In High School, one of my English teachers suggested that when we find a sentence that seems too long or "bothers us", we should begin trying to find the purpose of that sentence. When I write, I tend to use more words than necessary just to make my writing sound more descriptive. For example, "When I was a child, my incredible Mother would work in the kitchen all day cooking the most flavorful and delicious food for dinner that made my family and I anticipate her voice calling us when it was done." By doing this, I have made a sentence that seems to run-on forever and loses the interest of the reader. However, the purpose of this sentence is to show how exciting it was for me as a child to have my Mother\'s home cooked meals. Therefore, I realized I do not need that much description to prove my point. I could split the sentence into two: "As a child, my Mother would cook the most amazing meals that she spent all day preparing. My family and I would sit and anticipate her voice calling us when it was done." This, in my opinion, sounds much better and clears up the meaning of the sentence. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I hope to gain a better understanding of analyzing text. With this skill, I know I can improve my writing vastly. I have always struggled with "digging deeper" and searching for important details or themes in others' writing. Therefore, when I must quote a piece of work in an essay, for example, I have a difficult time concentrating on a main idea. I think a good technique for this would be annotating and trying to organize my ideas before starting an essay that has no clear ending point. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Caleb Clarke ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Caleb Clarke Paku INTD-106 4/9/2019 I feel that one of my biggest strengths as a writer is my ability to convey complex ideas in a succinct manner. During my time in high school I took several Honors and advanced placement courses. My teachers would constantly encourage my classmates and I to focus on including only the most important points to support our ideas. Another area in which I excel is using strong logical arguments and bolstering my statements with my own ideas, especially related to topics that I am familiar with. I have several areas however, which I plan to improve on throughout my work in college. One of my main focuses will be using proper annotation when citing and using outside sources that properly conveys my ideas. I struggle with keeping the flow of my thoughts when I include ideas from outside sources. I tend to support my ideas so heavily with my own rationale, that citing outside sources typically becomes an afterthought. I usually spend so little time on these portions of my writing that I will recycle the same statements when introducing textual evidence. For example, I will often repeatedly use statements like "the author states" Or "the text states" when including quotes from outside sources, rather than taking the time to cite evidence in a way that flows with my own statements. An example of this is "Napoleon became a cruel leader. The text states, "The conditions under the cruel leader would continue to get worse. As Napoleon became more and more powerful, he likewise became more ruthless. Any animals who disobeyed Napoleon "\... were slain on the spot" (Orwell 93). It is important that I learn to select reliable sources and present them in a sophisticated way that will support my ideas because it will allow them to be taken far more seriously. As I strive to improve my writing in college I hope to learn how to use some of the techniques we will learn in our course text, "They Say, I Say" and employ parts of the templates to improve my use of textual evidence. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Clinton =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus mainly on connecting my ideas to evidence. I find this important because without this skill the paper would be all over the place and it would become confusing to the reader. With these connections the concepts in my essay serve as a subsequent pattern that explains what the writing is actually about. I was taught this skill by my English teacher in eleventh grade when learning to write my junior thesis about "The Power of Advertising". An example would be how advertisements can be potentially dangerous. Evidence to support that would be finding an article to support that and quoting it. I found an article about how companies advertise cigarettes and used my ideas and found evidence from the article to come up with good claims to support my overall topic. I then make sure my claims follow logically. In the future I would like to focus on creating a better thesis for my introductory paragraph. I think too much about what else is going on in my essay, so my thesis doesn't always fit into my writing. I need to find more examples on thesis\'s and ask for help among my peers to build my skill set. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Daniel Coffed =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I have previously strived in formatting my work in academic writing. Throughout high school, my English and history teachers spent much time training me and my classmates to correctly order and format an essay. With that being said, being able to clearly lay out my thoughts in an organized, concise, and well paced manner is something I think I am very good at. Being able to write a well organized paper is a very good skill to have because it allows the reader to follow a progression of points rather than having a disorganzed mess of facts. I remember toward the beginning of twelfth grade, my AP Literature teacher critiqued an essay I wrote. He said that my writing was good and but there wasn\'t enough organization to my work. He told me in order to get a better grade, I needed to expand on what I was saying and most importantly, fully develop my thoughts while keeping them at an appropriate length. I went back to work on my essay, finding more examples of experiments that had no real benefits and mostly stood to harm people. After this research I was able to add quotes from outside sources about this topic and expand on them. A couple sentences I added to the essay were \"You should not treat people bad for no reason, that\'s just evil. Victor Frankenstein is perhaps evil for creating such a cruel experiment\". I also took out the extra information in the essay which was interesting, but did not really help my point. After working with him and fixing my essay, I learned how to add more information to a work so that each point is clearly laid out but also proportionately covered. For the rest of senior year I solidified my ability to hit all the points in the body paragraph proportionately to the other parts of the essay, which led to my works being even more well organized and formatted. One thing I struggle with in academic writing that I\'d like to get better at is starting and developing a thought. Throughout high school, I usually received very good grades on papers and praise from my english teachers. However, two things that I struggled with throughout high school and still struggle with is being able to begin an essay as well as being able to elaborate on ideas. I can usually find enough information and I am very careful with my word choice but I often struggle to put words on to the paper (or document). ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gregory Cole-Allen ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Gregory Cole-Allen[jsjdknskdncdkdnfkdjnfkdnfjsdfksdfndjfnkfndjfnfkdnfkdfnkn]{style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ffffff;"}]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [9/4/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Reflective Essay [xnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnnlnxnxnnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnxnxn]{style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #ffffff;"}]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ I feel that the thesis of an essay makes or breaks the expected quality that the reader has in mind when reading a piece of literature.

I feel that this plugs into the pathos of the reader because everyone enjoys the fact they are distinct from others and also connects to the idea of the essay which was intended to introduce myself and what makes me different. What pushed me to build on this was my 11th grade English teacher, he would have us practice and practice it and would put large weights on essays just on the quality of the thesis statement.

This makes what I need to work on that I am going to list all that much more critical as I will not be building an emotional attachment to the graders as I would with that a teacher I can see every day or every other day in person. I am always open to learning more about writing since I am so weak in it though which is why I am optimistic coming into the INTD 105/106 course pair. What I feel I have to work on is sentence transitions and transitioning into a quote. A lot of my essays are very tough to read at times before review and sometimes after. I feel this would make my essays a lot easier to read. I can fix this by practicing my writing and having better writers read and fix my writing style.

For me, I find it difficult to figure out when to end a sentence and start a new one, and it often leaves my points jumbled with other words. If my essay were to have more concise points, then I believe that it would be much better for my audience to understand what I am trying to say. In the last essay I wrote, my audience was able to find my point, but they expressed their concern to me about how they had to re-read my essay over and over again, and that my sentences seemed to take up the entire paragraph. I have always struggled with finding the right words when writing, and I often find that I string together more words than I need in order to convey a point, and I believe that if I can learn where to position my punctuation, and make my sentences straight to the point, my essay would be much clearer. This being said, one of the aspects I want to work with on my writing is to get straight to the main argument/thesis of my paper, and try to make my writing much clearer for others to follow. Once I learn how to use better connecting words and better punctuation skills, I hope that my writing will be impacted in a positive way, and be very clear to understand. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Adam Comstock =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write, I always try to use the revision process to tighten up certain sentences and to make each phrase unique and purposeful. If a sentence does not flow properly, or is too confusing or vague, I will combine it with neighboring ones, split it in two, or perhaps cut it entirely. An English teacher of mine once told me that I have the ability to turn a phrase quite well. This skill has become very useful to me in turning essays, letters, etc. from decent works to ones that are more exemplary. The way I go about doing this, typically, is to read a sentence aloud as if it were part of a speech. If I feel as though the sentence does not fit with the rest of the work, or it is a struggle to read aloud, I will edit it. I have learned what, in my mind, makes a good sentence by reading a lot of other book and essays. These provide examples of exemplary writing. In a recent rough draft for an essay of mine, I wrote \"LeGuin shows the reader that power structures not only affect the actions a person does but they also affect the way the person thinks about things.\" When I read this sentence aloud, it feels clunky and poorly constructed. I notice that some verbs do not quite fit their subjects, and that the sentence feels abnormally long. In the revision process, that sentence becomes \"LeGuin shows the reader that power structure affect both the actions and thoughts of those subjected to them.\" In my mind, this sentence feels tighter, less bloated, and is easier to say aloud. In future essays, I would like to work on my ability to fit my ideas into a traditional format. I often find my self struggling with quote introductions and transitions, as well as what to do with introductions and conclusions. Perhaps this skill could be improved by reading more essays for examples of good transitions and structures. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Samuel Comstock ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [A focus of mine is that I don\'t overcomplicate my writing by using big words and get straight to the point. This was an issue when I drafted my college essay. I believe with moderation vocabulary can be good, but too much can complicate my writing. When I began drafting my first college essay, this became a big problem. Here is an example from my first essay drafted. "With patience, the gentle chickadee fed from the palm of my hand\... What was it about that bird that created this epiphany in my concrete operational brain?" After my teacher read my draft, he was very confused and told me, "This doesn\'t make sense with what your writing about. Get straight to the point and stop using crazy words". After hearing this advice from my teacher, it motivated me to start over completely and write a new essay with a new relatable message. I knew I had to refrain from using too much bold vocabulary that would interfere from the story and message within my writing. My teacher gave me a strategy where I start to write all my ideas through a story with minimal advanced vocabulary. Then, I had the freedom to make revisions where I thought my vocabulary could fit to make the story even better. With that being said, the pay off was unbelievable. Once my English Teacher saw my revisions, he was thoroughly impressed with my transition of story, and efficient use of vocabulary that did not interfere with the story and message, and I couldn\'t thank him enough for his assistance. Utilizing this strategy, I was able to not worry about sounding intellectual but focus on telling a story and on what I\'m trying to deliver to the audience. My college essay transformed into a story talking about an experience closer to home, as I talk about a diner that changed my life forever. Here is an example from my final essay. "Yes ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Diner]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ was infamous for their bad food and atmosphere, with its grimy floors, outdated paint, and prehistoric pictures of our hometown... But what really mattered was that treasured time with my father and how that diner made me feel at ease." A skill I intend to improve on at the college level would be my editing and revising process, to ensure my writing is concise and makes sense for the readers to comprehend.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Angela Consalazio =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Angela Consalazio 9-9-19 Throughout my previous essays, I have always focused on using transitional words to make my writing flow more smoothly. In my admission essay for the School of Education, I made sure I used transitional words to make my writing flow, so it is easier for my reader to understand. An example of my use of transitional words in my writing is, "Specifically, I would love to teach elementary education because the beginning stages of the students' personalities are created in their first years in school and I want to create a solid base for the person they will become in the long run". Another example from my School of Education admission essay states, "however, I may face challenges in the classroom maintaining discipline." The transitional words however and specifically give my writing more structure and it makes my piece unique and gives the reader a more active read. This skill is important because when I get older and need to apply for jobs, I will need to submit an essay using my skill of transitional words to make my writing sound better. Thus, it will give me a better opportunity for the job I am applying for. My English teacher in 12^th^grade stressed the importance of using transitional words in our writing and in my future pieces, I show that I use transitional words and phrases to move from one topic to another. In the future, I would like to focus more on making my sentences longer and not as choppy. I find difficulty in elaborating on topics and switching from one topic to another, which are some things I hope to improve on in this class. In paragraphs, I would have sentences that were all restating the same information, but I made multiple sentences out of it to make my writing longer. Going forward, I want to improve on these difficulties I have in writing papers, I want to become more confident in my writing, and I want to use more complex vocabulary in order to make my writing the best it can be. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Johnathan Conway ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Johnathan Conway]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106-01]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [10 September 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When writing, there is a multitude of components that must be put together to create a decent piece of work. These components are known as writing skills. In order to write a piece of work that is decent, I believe that punctuation should be one hundred percent correct. If punctuation is not correct, the audience may interpret your writing as something that is not or may just cause confusion. This confusion could cause the audience to misinterpret your topic or statement just because of small punctuation errors. Throughout my high school English courses, my teachers emphasized the importance of punctuation with a "conventions of writing" checklist. The way this checklist worked was simple: if your teacher checks every box on the checklist, you get ten points towards your paper. If you did not get all the checks, you were penalized ten points. These checkboxes consisted of specific punctuational suggestions that should be included in the writing. An example of using this punctuation would be in the use of appositives, a word or phrase used to define the noun phrase preceding it (Grammarbook), and commas to proceed them. In one of my past reports in high school on the novel ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Stranger]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, I use appositive commas in my claim, "Throughout ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Stranger]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, Meursault, the main character, is an example of this existential philosophy that free will and the actions taken by an individual have consequences", to define the main character's identity. The incorporation of the defining phrase in between the commas clarifies who the character is and their significance. I also use conjunctive adverbs and phrases in my writing using words like "however", "therefore", and "as a result" to convey a more dramatic effect. Most of my English teachers at high school encourage using Purdue Owl as a resource to advance our writing skills; consequently, I became conscious of my punctuation errors and began to revise my writing at a more advanced level. I believe that writing is an essential part of society and being able to elegantly write is advantageous, so I also learn as many skills as I can. Learning different techniques to writing adds a unique touch to your writing when incorporated and can help to convey ideas better. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Throughout this writing course, I look forward to advancing the organization of my thoughts in my writing. Whenever I write a big paper or essay, my thoughts are scrambled and my writing comes out unorganized. I would like to learn how to be more creative and efficient in coming up with topics or thesis\'. My biggest struggle is actually starting writing because I can never think of what I\'m going to say. Maybe thoroughly learning about a topic before I write may help my writers\' block.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Cook ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [[In my writing, I make sure to establish a very strong introduction or thesis statement to ensure I convey the main point immediately. Without a powerful thesis statement, the audience will lose interest and find your writing unclear. In my thesis I try to be very specific and support it with strong evidence. As I continue to write, I shape the rest of my introduction around it so the thesis stands out to the reader. For my college essay, I wrote about my first job. My thesis was originally weak, but got the message across: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Having a job in high school was a great experience and I learned many things. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ By the end of my essay, my writing was much stronger and my closing was able to wrap up the true importance of my first job.

Improved vocabulary will develop my writing and clarify my message. Feedback I have received from my English teachers helped me recognize the simplified language I use. I've been told I often write as if I'm having a conversation with a person. Those sentences are often vague, which makes the reader have to constantly reread my writing. When I read other people's work, like my teachers or classmates, I notice the usage of higher-leveled vocabulary. Personally, I feel like I'm more intrigued and drawn to the more persuasive and interesting vocabulary.

I'd like to attribute my knowledge of grammar to my grandfather, who taught as both a high school teacher of English for thirty-two years and a college professor of English for seventeen years at Stony Brook University, training future teachers of English.

margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When composing a form of writing, whether it be a long essay or a simple email, I believe it is important to focus on reaching the direct point quickly and efficiently. As someone is reading my writing, the last thing I want is for them to feel any sense of confusion or the need to skip ahead in order to understand the purpose of my composition. This is a very important skill as it keeps the reader engaged. Throughout high school, my English teachers constantly reminded me of this skill. Instead of beginning my writing with "Pricing Beauty is published novel written by former model Ashley Mears. It began when she went undercover for a sociology research project. She spent time with those who encouraged her and those who brought her spirits down. Mears experienced what it was like to work in a competitive environment surrounded by race, genders, and labels." This is too much information to begin with. A better approach would be, "The modeling industry has been around for centuries, allowing men and women to project their love for fashion. The novel Pricing Beauty is told by Ashley Mears, as she reflects on her modeling days. The authors purpose is to explain what happens behind the scenes of the modeling world and how race, gender, and labels play an important role in the industry." As I move forward in writing, I think it is important to focus on the details I incorporate in my composition. I believe that sometimes I assume the reader automatically knows what I am talking about which can lead to them feeling like they do not want to continue reading my work since they do not understand it. I either much too put information into my writing or not enough.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} (296 words) ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gwendolyn Cunningham ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on reinforcing my arguments with as much detail as possible while also bringing up the contradicting view point and its supporting ideologies. This helps me refute the opposing side as best I can, while also seeing validity to their argument. If I only support my viewpoint, my writing seems bias and therefore less reliable. Frequently in high school, my teachers would tell us to always evaluate and include the opposing viewpoint to increase the validity of the writing piece. One should anticipate why the reader would feel a different way and attempt to understand why they could object your claim. In both my writing classes and public speaking course we were taught a specific pattern to approach this type of essay. For example, in an argumentative essay about why uniforms are not ideal for schools, I would list and detail the reasons why they shouldn't be worn in my first two paragraphs and support my thesis. Then, in the third paragraph I would state, "Many may decide that wearing school uniforms decreases the chance for distractions and provide an environment of equality but, uniqueness within children should be expressed and encouraged. School uniforms degrade the pursuit of self-expression. Therefore, I refute their claim but also create an understanding as to why readers may feel this way. In the future, I'd like to focus on creating further developed thesis'. In high school, I had difficulty expressing my opinion in a manner that was concise and to the point. I find it awkward when presenting my opinion to readers and hope that I can find the confidence to state my thoughts in writing. Hopefully, I can further my own thoughts and concentrate on using them to support my argument as well as the ideas of others. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brionn Currier ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} \ An aspect of writing that I would like to improve my use of colons and semicolons Currently, my understanding of when either is appropriate to use is shaky at best. Whenever I choose to utilize either it has been essentially a coin flip where the outcome is either I am correct or I get a point or so knocked off for the misuse of punctuation. As is, I feel absolutely ridiculous for not understanding useful tools in academic writing and often find myself rewriting and retooling essays in order to avoid the utilization of colons and semicolons. Naturally, there are circumstances where no amount of semantic fiddling will avoid their necessity and in those situations, I have to defer to a peer for help and more often than not, they also don't know how to use these bits of punctuation either and all I receive is a shrug. Leaving me with the option to just stab blindly and ask myself "Does this look right?". Up until this point that haphazard approach has seemingly panned out fine but is an unfulfilling and tenuous "method", if one could call it that, to take. An example of my shakiness in the usage of semicolons can be observed in the following \"\...but \[a scientific joke\] also serves multiple functions as well; as a means to signal the joke-teller's intelligence as well as gauge the intelligence of the recipient and also as a way to subvert the often dry nature of scientific topic\....\" here it is used to connect a sentence about jokes to about what that joke represents. Another example can be seen here in an excerpt from a different essay \"principles presented in their paper; *Emergence, Positionality, Indexicality, Relationality, and Partialness*\" in which it seems I awkwardly crammed in a semicolon to lead into the title of an essay. Thus leads me to why I believe it is, of course, important to learn the proper usage of colons and semicolons, it seems ridiculous to have two punctuation marks be seemingly shrouded in so much ambiguity just because I must have dozed off in high school English class at some point. Those forms of punctuation have a purpose in writing and regular rules to follow in their deployment and to avoid using them on the grounds of ignorance is wholly unacceptable on my end. Going forward from here I would like to more effectively develop my confidence in not only employing those two forms of punctuation but accepting good-faith criticism in general, since there is no doubt in my mind that some point some individual has suggested the use of one or pointed out my error and I simply ignored them for the sake of ego or embarrassment. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Dan Daddario ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Self-Reflection \#1]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335551550":2,"335551620":2,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [Even when I first began to write from a young age and in elementary school as well as middle school, the use of imagery was an integral part of my writing. For a child and developing writer using images, symbols and experience provides an easy way to communicate between yourself and the reader. It is often difficult to have the same use of words with underdeveloped skills in writing. Even now, as a more developed and experienced writer, I find that imagery remains as one of the simplest yet more effective ways of relation between the reader and the text. Humans are very visual beings. Many of us work well with being able to see something or visualize it. Furthermore, the use of imagery creates a way to appeal to the senses of the reader, making the description easier to relate to. When writing my college application essay, I relied heavily on imagery, hoping the reader would be able to understand and feel the experiences I had gone through, rather simply throwing meaningless words on a page that had no depth to them. After reviewing my initial outline and draft with my guidance counselor, we discussed ways to enhance my visuals and provide more specific and detailed images to the reader. My topic focused around the meaningfulness of my cross-country team and its success to me. I tried to use more individual and specific examples to myself, such as describing my enormous voice crack when my team and I found out we had made it to the state championships while we were screaming at the top of our lungs with excitement In addition to more specific details, we discussed about incorporating an appeal to senses. I was able to describe the perfect fall day, with a cool breeze and freshly groomed golf course with each blade of grass perfectly cut on the fairway. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335551550":1,"335551620":1,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":480}"} [Even though many aspects of my writing are very proficient, and I use various techniques, I would want to be able to further develop my usage of rhetorical devices rather than rely heavily on literary devices.

I feel like my writing is very "hard" there's nothing graceful about the way I convey my ideas. However, concise writing is easy to understand and it allows the ideas to have the main stage instead of collections of unnecessary SAT words. There's merit to both styles of writing and I appreciate them both equally, but when I'm reading I don't want to have to unpack the meaning of obscure words that do nothing but flaunt the authors vast vocabulary. For example, I would write "Lady Macbeth's manipulation of her husband led to the couple's fatal downfall". I could add more descriptive words that characterize Lady Macbeth.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} [ ]{.Apple-tab-span} I had the same English teacher for 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, so we got very close, and I was familiar with her teaching style. She taught me everything I know about writing and constantly pushed me to write out of my comfort zone. She always wanted me to have more finesse to my writing instead of being so blunt. This could be remedied by working on transitions and establishing a flow early on in a paper. Ultimately, my goal is to make my academic writing enjoyable to read. I want the reader to see me in the paper, and to be amused when it's appropriate.

This is important to keep the reader interested as if a story was being told, and to maintain the focus on the main idea. My eleventh grade English teacher emphasized the importance of continuously peaking the interest of the reader throughout my writing, in order to keep them from being bored and forgetting the purpose. Specifically, giving details of an example or story, in each paragraph, that I have experienced that directly relates to the thesis. For example, I wrote my college essay about overcoming a major obstacle in my life, my mother passing away, and how it inspired me to work harder. In one paragraph I discussed how my mother was an educator, which made me focus more on school and strive to maintain a ninety overall gpa. The following paragraph consisted of how she would always encourage me to work hard on the basketball court, which led me to talk about how successful my high school basketball career was despite her passing. I'm grateful I obtained this knowledge from my teacher because it makes writing overall easier and even fun when sharing personal experiences. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While I'm here at Geneseo I hope to learn how to effectively write a conclusion paragraph and concluding statements. Sometimes I find it challenging to not repeat things I previously stated in my introduction. I also would like to extend my vocabulary to sound more sophisticated while writing.

It is the thing I prioritize most because it is the base of any respectable piece of writing. After every paper I write, I go over it to check sentence structure and word choice, but I'm not concerned about my spelling and grammar. On rare occasions, I find errors in my word tense. For example, while I am writing, if I decide to alter the tense of a verb, sometimes I think too far ahead and I don't go back to change the tense. I recently discovered an online tool called Grammarly, which checks my writing for spelling, grammatical, and sentence structure issues. It doesn't fix my errors for me, it highlights my errors and provides suggestions on how to fix it, so I still have the freedom to change my mistakes and learn for myself. This resource has pushed me to constantly think about what I am writing while I'm writing it because I take pride in my writing and believe that becoming better is important. Recently I applied to the School of Education, and I needed to write an application essay explaining why I want to be a teacher. My paper was written hastily, and I had to go back and fix many things. For example, I had written, "When a teacher seems irritable, closed, or not friendly, it is a turnoff to a studnet who is seeking help and ask questipns" A handful of my sentences had spelling errors, unfavorable word choice, and wrong forms of adjectives. I had to revise it to say "When a teacher seems irritable, closed-off, or unfriendly, it is a turn-off to a student who is seeking help and ask questions." While this grammar and spelling was an easy fix, keeping my paper under two pages was very difficult.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Making my writing more concise and to the point is something I struggle with and want to improve on.

I believe the skill of using concise is crucial in writing and I soon realized how much I struggled with it while writing my college essay. Once I began my AP History class my sophomore year I knew I needed help when I was not getting the grades on my essays I wanted. I went back to my freshman year history teacher, I enjoyed her much more than the teacher I had for the class and she knew how to teach AP style writing, she helped me better work on my skills to not just understand and repeat but synthesize the information I was taking in and writing about. The last essay I wrote was my final for psychology in May. I took a statement like, "Culture shapes the individual minds of its people and behaviors as much as the minds and behaviors of the people shape the culture" and changed into "Our culture shapes us as much as we shape it," and used examples to support my claims such as the \#MeToo movement and the cultures we come from. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I got into more complex writing in high school I struggled with writing my thesis more then I would struggle with research or even the body paragraphs which would be the bulk of my writing.

This is because without a good transition into you're next thought it makes the work confusing and makes it feel like you are jumping around. I feel like I use this skill well because of my english teacher in twelfth grade. In a one on one meeting about my personal narrative, draft one he wrote a comment on how my paper seemed to jump and not flow well. After going back and re reading my paper I noticed what he was talking about. After adding transition words to my paper, it made the paper have a smoother flow to it. I then started using this tip in not only my english papers but other subjects as well. It was very helpful in DBQ in social studies as well as. With adding transition words to all my papers I noticed them making more sense and I was getting higher grades. In a lot of templates we would get in class they would always have the transitions on the paper, once I got into a higher english class in twelfth grade that stopped.

I still remember my 8th grade English teacher preaching, "CCIC." Claim, cite interpret and connect. I have a claim in the beginning, I use a quote and analyze it through the claim. It is important to have structure so the essay does not have tangents. I like to have three supporting arguments with at least three quotes for each. My last essay was a psychological interpretation of the character, Little Red Riding Hood in the musical "Into The Woods." My claim was that as a person matures, they were introduced to an increasing amount of inferiorities. One paragraph would be about her innocence before starting on the journey and the superiority a child feels. The second paragraph would be about how she entered the woods and experienced hardships, thus discovering inferiority. Then the last paragraph would be about how the maturing changes the dynamic between superiority and inferiority. The evidence portion would be a small quote, "Isn't it nice to know a lot, and a little bit not." I would say something along the lines of "when she entered the woods, she learned about the difficulties of the journey and then I would end it there and move onto the next quote. I believe I should think about my claims more deeply and about all the tertiary connections to come with a theme for the essay and each paragraph.

This is a phrase I heard for the first time in my twelfth grade SUPA creative writing class. My teacher would always write "SDT" on my drafts, to remind me to not just summarize an event, but to use descriptive words and feelings to make the reader experience the story as if they were there. I would hear this phrase thousands of times in his class and he would always be reminding us, so this aspect is ingrained in my brain and it is something I always consciously focus on when I'm writing.

An academic example of telling is when I moved from the thought of, "The vegan diet isn't as healthy as it is made out to be." to this sentence revised to "showing" as, "Although many celebrities and influencers to promote the vegan diet, 86% of vegans are deficient in vitamin B12, which is an essential vitamin."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of writing I want to develop is balancing ethos, pathos, and logos.

It also helps the readers to imagine what I am describing more clearly. Without a wide variety of vocabulary, I find myself to be repeating the same words over and over again. My eleventh grade AP Capstone teacher would always tell us to use vocabulary the audience would understand. He also reminded us that our vocabulary should pertain to our topic. An example of using a wide range of vocabulary would be: "The first time I ever mounted a horse was when I was 5 years old." Instead of casually saying, "the first time I ever got on a horse," I used the word "mounted." By using this word, it not only makes the writing sound more concise, but this vocabulary word also pertains to the topic of my writing. I think this course will provide a greater understanding of what skills I can use in order to enhance my writing. I believe knowing and being able to use a variety of different skills is a key concept in writing growth. These skills will allow me to get the message across in a more effective way. One thing I would definitely like to work on is integrating other people's arguments into my writing so that I can use it to further my own. With this, I also need to work on analyzing and summarizing people's ideas so that my writing isn't just quotes.

I find it beneficial to start an essay with a riveting thesis statement that engages the reader from the moment they begin reading the piece. A weak thesis statement can lead to a majority of readers losing interest before they are even a sentence into the paper. This is a fundamental skill that my twelfth grade english teacher heavily stressed during the year. Even though, a thesis statement may only be one sentence long it should express the main focus of the paper and then assert a disputable claim. I am confident in my skill to create an eye-catching thesis. However, my writing skills are not stelar and still could use a lot of improvement. Details are a crucial factor in constructing a strong essay. However, the addition of too many details makes it extremely difficult for the reader to understand the main point of the piece. While reviewing my past essays I realized that it is beneficial to back your thesis with relevant and sufficient details in an organized manner. One of my past essays that caught my eye was about Malcolm X. Throughout this essay I placed heavy emphasis on specific issues Malcolm X encountered. This resulted in an essay full of lengthy and overly detailed paragraphs that would leave most readers perplexed. I shortened the tedious paragraphs into a simple summary, "After his pilgrimage he was able to broaden his perspectives and became open to equality.

If my thesis doesn't answer the essay question clearly the reader will not be able to identify my position on the topic. I'm pretty confident that I can strongly assert my position on a given topic by using good writing techniques I received from my high school English teachers to support my own claims. My teachers encouraged me to state both the idea and its significance precisely enough that a reader would be able to understand what my perspective is in the essay. An example of an old thesis of my is "A major issue that the indigenous people faced was that the Ecuadorian government was permitting these Chinese mining companies to start drilling on these areas of the forest inhabited by these people without their consent." A better way to state this thesis would be "The indigenous people were experiencing many hardships from the Ecuadorian government such as allowing Chinese mining companies to use their land without permission." In the future, I would like to focus on writing stronger conclusions so I can correctly wrap up my future essays. I think I have difficulty with properly ending my claims and then I feel as if my essay is incomplete and lacks structure. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kayla Demosthene ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Kayla Demosthene\ Reflective Essay\ INTD 106 Throughout my writing process, I focus on gathering enough information about my topic in order to create a paper that the reader can clearly understand. I believe that knowing how to correctly research your topic is a very essential skill, especially in college. Learning this skill has prepared myself to write papers that will provide enough evidence for the topic. One of my professors, Mr. Wensel, taught my class how to research your topic using scholarly journals and articles. When writing a paper you must also cite the sources that you use. An example of research that must be cited would be " Citizens have claimed that racial segregation prevents social learning, the exposure of children to cultural practices other than their own, and ultimately greater racial interaction" (Johnson, 2014). This quote would then have to be cited using APA format which would look like,\ Johnson Jr, Odis (2014).

I believe that this skill will improve through experience and learning from my professors. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sean Dennis ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing I focus on making sure that the piece is well organized and flows naturally. It is very important that the different parts of a writing piece are placed logically or else it may not make sense to the reader. In other words, organization makes things easier to understand. My high school teachers always taught me to make sure my writing is organized by first planning out the order and direction of topics beforehand on a separate page. This ensures that there is little to no room for error. An example of a revision I would make is when I feel that the topics are not flowing properly, I will switch the order by which they are stated, based on a planning sheet I was given by my teacher. I use this planning sheet to first lay out ideas I have for the piece of writing, and then arrange the example as I go along. This can oftentimes be overlooked though, which is why revision is necessary to make things make sense to the end reader. An example of this is when I was writing a history paper in 12th grade. I had to discuss the causes of world war 1 before I talked about the causes of world war 2 so it made sense in context. \'World war one was caused by\...world war two was caused by\...\'. If I did not have this sequential order done properly, the causes of world war 2 would not make sense to the reader. In my writing in the future I want to get better at making evidence based claims. I currently find it difficult to back my claim up with proper evidence that makes sense and flows with the rest of the writing, so going forward I want to strengthen this skill of mine. This skill allows claims to be less refutable which gives me(the writer) more value. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katie de Onis =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [A focus of mine is how I organize my writing because it helps the reader to follow along. When an essay is disorganized, I cannot get my point across to the reader because my ideas are not coming across in a clear manner. Distraction can completely derail a great piece of writing. Before I begin writing I break down my key points and lay them out in different orders to see which sequence makes the most sense. I started using this method while writing my senior thesis in twelfth grade. Previous teachers taught me to break down ideas by paragraphs, but I found it helps to break paragraphs down as well to drive the point home. When I wrote the biography portion of my thesis my ideas were all over the place, so I had to connect two examples in a way that didn't confuse the reader. I had to write about Michael Crichton's academic career, achievements, personal life, aliases, and writing career. I decided to start with a paragraph on his academic career and then go onto his writing career because it fit together best, "To put himself through medical school he started writing novels, one of those novels was his first best seller, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Andromeda Strain]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[." Putting these two ideas together works well because there is a clear transition from one to the next.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future I'd like to focus on word choice. My language is very repetitive and I believe that can cause my writing to become dull and less engaging. I hope I can draw the audience in and hold their attention with words I might not have considered using before.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Caroline Depaolis =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Caroline DePaolis Throughout my years of writing papers for classes, letters to friends, and emails to teachers, I have found that the skill I focus most on is detail. By being very detailed, I can ensure the reader not only picture the situation but understand it better as well. I believe that using detail to create an image is imperative because it holds the reader's attention. As a senior in high school I decided to take a public speaking class. The class involved writing papers on a given topic and then presenting them in front of the class. As I knew my public speaking skills were limited, I decided this was a great opportunity for me. One of the first assignments was to give a speech on something you are afraid of. I chose space. I wanted my presentations to be engaging, making sure I wouldn't lose my audience. I wrote "In 1957, the first satellite, Sputnik, was launched into space. It was mankind's first attempt to reach beyond the comfortable confines of earth." Although this is a factual sentence, if I were to present this speech again, I would write "In 1957, Sputnik, was launched into space. Though only the size of a beach ball and weighing only 180 pounds, this tiny satellite had a huge impact as it was mankind's first attempt to reach beyond the comfortable confines of earth." Or, instead of a sentence like "With each mission we learn more about the space around us, it's vastness, and just how little we really know" I would write "With each new and innovative mission we learn more about the mysteries of space, it's vastness, and just how little we really know. " One area of my writing that I would like to develop is the flow of my work. My high school writing teacher stressed the importance of using a template whenever writing. Basically, the template involved an introduction, two supporting body paragraphs, and a conclusion to tie back into the introduction. Even though I have found this invaluable, sometimes when I am writing I have a flood of thoughts. And, in my haste to get all my thoughts on the page, I tend to jump around. I feel like I need to do a better job of presenting my thoughts in a smoother, more digestible format to the reader. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Amber Derienzo ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} A writing skill that I find important is being able to explain topics well. If you aren\'t able to explain a topic effectively, the paper won\'t make any sense. What made me realize this was some of my other teachers. They taught me that just because I know what something is, it doesn\'t mean that everyone does. They taught to explain something as if no-one has heard of it before. Being able to explain things effectively was very important last year during my senior year English class. We had to write a research paper about any topic we wanted and I chose to write about veganism. Even though I knew what it was, I also knew that there were many people that didn\'t know what it was, so it was important to explain what the word vegan means. \"[Being vegan means that she doesn't eat any products that come from an animal. Some of these products are meat, dairy, eggs, and seafood. As well as not consuming any animal products, she doesn't use any products that are tested on animals\". This quote is what I wrote in the essay to explain to the reader what veganism is. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}An important part of writing is being able to continue to grow and learn new techniques and ways to write a paper. In this course I hope to find a way to not repeat myself as much. I think that when I write I use some of the same words multiple time because I don\'t know a way to use different words or phrases that will still get my point across clearly. I think the best way to fix this is to just keep looking for syllables or other phrases that mean the same thing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jessica Deringer ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [[Jessica Deringer ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW203445384 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW203445384 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"} [[In my summary of the book I was reading at the time, I keep the reader interested by adding my interpretation of the novel rather than just listing the events. This is a skill I developed in a writing class I took where we often summarized movies we watched in class. From constantly summarizing plots my teacher always recommended showing your interpretation. This skill has helped me write summaries ever since. An example of this is, "This is an early sign in the novel of how their relationship takes a turn for the worst and a major red flag to what an unhealthy relationship looks like", this tells the reader what foreshadowing clues that they would be observing at this point in the story, without them actually reading it. It is very necessary when writing to use this skill in order to not drag your essay on and keep the reader interested. In my essay I wrote, "The main characters are in total denial that they are falling in love, however it is obvious in their actions; such as inviting each other into not only their homes, but their private lives", this shows how I analyze their actions instead of just telling what happened. This helps the reader of my essay feel like they\'re reading the story and picking up on clues.

Traditionally in high-school essay writing we are taught to have an introductory paragraph that ends with a thesis, setting up the rest of the essay. However, when I write I don't like to constrain myself to just this one paragraph. Sometimes a topic needs to be put in context before it can be properly discussed, and if it takes two or three paragraphs to get there then I'm fine with that. For my senior exit project, I was required to find a political issue, research it, then form an opinion regarding the topic and justify it in essay form. I chose to look into the effect of people's religion on their political standing, and my thesis read as follows;]{style="font-weight: 400;"}["One of the founding principles of our country was that religion and government are to not interfere with one another, but with every single decision we make judged on a system of morals which stems from primordial truths found in some form of religion (or not in the case of nihilism), religion is one of the most absolutely critical components of our politics." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[I found that it was difficult to hook a reader on this subject because it isn\'t something as tangible as, say, abortion, and without sufficient context this statement would seem either unreasonable or not worthwhile. Therefore, I needed to spend several paragraphs justifying my topic's importance before reaching the thesis statement, and in doing so was able to make a seemingly trivial topic more prevalent to the reader. My teacher said he liked this writing technique, which was important to me because although I had written in this style prior, it wasn't until this assignment senior year that a teacher had acknowledged the viability of this writing strategy to me.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An area of writing I personally struggle with sometimes is properly stringing different sentences together. I believe that sometimes a paragraph I write will read more like a group of statements instead of one, cohesive expression of an idea. I think taking time to rewrite old sentences to fit with new ones works well for this, however I struggle to do this in a way that doesn't derail my thought process and slow my writing down immensely.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lauren DeVinny ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing I focus on making my thesis clear and concise. This way the overall message of my work is clearly stated and the readers can follow the focus of my literary work throughout the piece. One of the challenges I had in my writing was I had trouble sticking to one topic, and my papers used to get confusing and hard to follow for the reader. Throughout my highschool career, my english teachers suggested to clarify key terms in my thesis to help solve this problem. Going off of having a clear thesis, I often revise the structure of my paper, so the statements flow well together. For my college acceptance essay the main focus of my paper was how my fear of failure has affected and changed my life. I continuously edited the paper to improve the structure and the overall flow. My 12th grade enlgish teacher helped me break down my college essay and improve all aspects of the paper as a whole, with our main focus being on having a clear and concise thesis. My thesis stated that "my fear of failure affected everything, from being afraid of messing up in sports, to giving myself anxiety over failing a test." Throughout the rest of my paper I gave prime example how my fear of failure affected my daily life, which all relate back to my thesis. "This fear of failure affected everything, from being afraid of messing up in sports, to giving myself anxiety over failing a test." To make my thesis stand out even more I chose to highlight how I overcame my fear of failure. "I soon began to realize that volunteering brought peace back into my life. I do think about failing or letting someone down when I help others" I concluded my paper with, "my weakness is my fear of failure, but now in my life, instead of hiding from it, I choose to confront it and to work to overcome it" With this concluding statement, I stated the meaning of my work as a whole, and then my plan to solve the problem.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward, I would love to focus on improving aspects of my research papers. I strive to make them more lively and use less quotes from other from other sources. Elaborating on my points will hopefully give the paper more flavor and show more of my voice and less of someone else\'s. I plan to achieve this goal in college, by continuing to write freewrites in my english class. This should allow for me to find my voice and learn to weave it throughout my paper.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Amina Diakite =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a person who has always loved English class growing up, I had always considered myself an adequate writer. That was of course, until I arrived at college. In high school while writing essays I always concentrated on word choice. And as an aspiring journalist and practicing poet, that is an aspect that I still focus on very heavily. I like my pieces to not only flow, and sound nice. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Diction for me is an important skill because it's not always about what you say, but how you choose to convey what you want to say. And that can make the difference between an interesting and well written piece to me. One thing that high school has drilled into me is the structure of a "well written" essay, something I have not quite mastered. In history class, my high school teachers taught me to write in M.E.A.L paragraph format where M, would stand for the main sentence, E would stand for example, A, would stand for the link between the example and the evidence, and L, would be the link or transition to the next paragraph, and the reiteration to the main sentence. The only trouble that I seemed to find with the format was the "main or topic sentence." It would be difficult for me to create a strong topic sentence, and to not find myself repeating things that I\'ve written in the introduction throughout the essay. I know the topic sentence or thesis statement is important because it informs the reader as to why they are reading your piece and why your essay is important. I want to be able to support my claims with concrete details, while also not being repetitive. I know in history class when I wrote my essays, they would be very redundant and would lack luster. I know repetition in some cases could be good but I haven\'t found balance. In a topic sentence I would claim that "The Natives migrated in order to find food and shelter." And in my body paragraphs when explaining why they moved it would be yet again " to find food" or " to find shelter" I want to be able to give more in my body paragraphs while also keeping focus on my topic sentence. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward diction and the flow of my writing is something I feel like I have not yet mastered. Sometimes I realize that focusing too much can also lead me to adding unnecessary fluff where i'm not able to get my point clearly and precisely. I hope this class can help me do that. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Erika Dick ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I pay the majority of my attention to ensuring that I develop a discussion within my arguments. In writing where research is overused, the author's voice is lost and the paper is less powerful. Therefore, I believe it is important to focus most on expanding on the research evidence used in my claims. I am confident in my ability of this skill because of the style of writing I was taught in twelfth grade by my English teacher. This technique involves stating a claim, supporting it with evidence, and then elaborating on it. Since learning this method, I rely less on published material, which reduces the amount of quotes used and increases the argumentative discussion in my voice. Doing so makes my paper stronger, as I can use my own words to enforce the argument. For example, in a paper I wrote on euthanasia, after using a quote, I briefly explained what the quote was showing. My teacher encouraged me to rewrite my ideas by developing a discussion from the quote to have a greater effect on the audience. The quote referenced was, "\...]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[as people have the right to live with dignity, they also have the right to die with dignity" (The Conversation). I explained that the quote showed how euthanasia gives people the right to die with dignity as they can choose to end their suffering on their own terms rather than those of the disease. After rewriting, my explanation read, "Disease takes away the dignity of the person it infects; however, euthanasia gives patients the ability to restore their dignity as well as choose how they die. Patients who are suffering from deadly illnesses can be given the option to end their suffering peacefully rather than painfully, on their own terms. This choice allows patients to take back control of their bodies and therefore regain their dignity."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [During my time at Geneseo and in my future endeavors as well, I would like to concentrate more on using a stronger vocabulary. I am too dependent on vocabulary that I am familiar with and I believe this makes my arguments less effective and persuasive. I am always eager to learn more and improve my writing skills and I feel as though learning more advanced vocabulary and being able to use it in my writing would create a more powerful paper.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kasey Dillenbeck ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I have always been the type of writer who focuses less on fancy words and grammar and more on being clear and easy to read. The skill I try to focus on the most when I am revising is cutting down my sentences to be the least wordy as possible and cutting down long phrases into single words. This skill is important because if an essay is easy to read, clear, and concise, the reader will better understand what you are trying to say. The purpose of writing an essay is to get a point across and I want to make that as easy and entertaining for my reader as possible. My AP English teacher has helped me hone this skill because in her class we only had forty minutes to write an essay so we had to get our point across as quickly and concisely as possible. An example of this is a research paper I wrote on San Francisco\'s homelessness problem. One sentence I wrote that needed to be revised and simplified was "San Francisco is one of the wealthiest cities in America known for its tourism, which accounts for a large amount of the cities wealth. The once wealthy and reputable city is now facing much more serious issues, namely human feces littering the streets due to an increased homeless population." After revising, I changed the sentence to: " ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[San Francisco is one of the wealthiest cities in America and was once a prime location for tourism.

I want to challenge myself to find new styles of writing to incorporate into my papers. Another area I want to develop is reducing my repetition. I feel that I often repeat myself when I lack focus on my thesis. Also I need to strengthen my analysis because I feel like I often make strong claims but I do not expand upon them enough. Possible developments in the areas of repetition, new styles, and analysis will come from taking risks and really focusing on how I am writing rather than what I am writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(400 Words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Soy Dinzler ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Soy Dinzler]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Throughout high school, I've felt that I was a pretty solid writer despite not enjoying writing as much as I should be. Writing is a great way to express anything you\'re trying to convey whether that\'s a point or your feelings. I've always known that I've been at least decent at descriptive writing, and an example of my descriptors being a few sentences from a Nature Writing seminar I had a few days ago. "The old cobblestone path reaching its abrupt end, meeting the newly laid concrete sidewalk. The old clashing with the new, much like the brutalist architecture of Livingston and the modern and elegant style of its counterpart." Though I believe I can create a world in the minds of the readers. I feel like there is no limit to being a descriptive writer, there\'s always a better way to portray a setting or situation. I have drastically improved to even come close to this point in my writing, even if it does look novice to a more avid writer. I can only thank my many highschool teachers that have supported me through my high school career for my great improvement in my writing skill and my fluent ability to speak. I am eager to soak up more knowledge and writing techniques. The one thing I believe I need the most improvement is in my structure. I often find myself struggling to fluently transition my information fluently rather than have it listed on a page. I know if I had a better understanding of just basic writing structure my writing could be much more fluent and interesting. I plan to focus on this aspect and learn more from my current professors, much like how my high school teachers were able to shape me into a better writer.

Whether they are simply periods or just normal transitions, it helps to give flow to the writing. This is important because when someone is reading your paper, they will understand your ideas more clearly. If someone has bad punctuation, it gives it an automatic child-like feel to the piece. I started to learn about better words to use in essays in 8th grade. We learned about subordinating conjunctions and a song that went with it. The concept was that the sentence could be flipped one way or another, and it would still make sense. For example, one could say, "Although the lesson seemed difficult, it only took an hour to do" and then flip it to say, "It only took an hour to do although the lesson seemed difficult." Another story of when I learned about finding better punctuation marks was in 11th grade. My teacher realized that many of us did not know how to write semicolons. She turned the lesson around from reading one of the assigned passages in the textbook to properly utilizing semicolons. One example of this one is "The class stared in disbelief at the long test; they only had one option." During my time at Geneseo, I would like to learn how to make my essays more attractive to the reader. I believe that my essays are often very bland and tasteless. This way, I can be more confident in what I'm writing. I have already bought a book for my INTD 105 class called They Say I Say.

However, I actively sought out teachers and tutors in school that assisted me with the writing process. They gave out handouts and web links that gave me some guidance. While working on one of my final highschool papers, I was able to submit outlines and rough drafts to my teacher for revision. It was an argumentative essay, so I needed to educate the reader about my position. From speaking with my teacher, I knew that I started off with a thesis that was a little too vague. To revise this, I thought about what I wanted to take away from my essay and the points that I really wanted to drive home. The thesis of the paper was arguing for the ban of animal testing, and promotion of alternate forms of product testing. The support that I used came from the reports of abuse to animals while products were tested on them. Their eyes and skin would become severely damaged. In many cases, they would die. I also used support from reports of new, more accurate forms of testing, in which animals were not used. I utilized the effectiveness and convience of the new forms of product testing to support my arguement that animal testing should be ended. From there, I continued to narrow down my thesis and make it more precise. By the end, I had a strong thesis that the reader could both understand and respond to. One aspect that I would like to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo and beyond is how to order my papers. Sometimes, I do not know where a paragraph best fits into the order of the paper. I would like to know how to format things so that my ideas flow easily, so that nothing feels out of place. To work on my writing weaknesses here at Geneseo, I could go to the writing center to get feedback on my essays. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ryan Drake ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Ryan Drake INTD 106 05 September 2019 Self-Reflective Assignment [ ]{.Apple-tab-span}As a writer, I was never seen as the best or strongest and I never enjoyed writing very much in high school; I did however notice that I was very capable of constructing a good introductory paragraph for every essay that I wrote.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}To me, the introductory paragraph is highly important because it usually contains your thesis and sets up the rest of the paragraph by giving it[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}a focus, or topic.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}My ability to develop a good and brief, but informative, first paragraph is due[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}mostly to my teacher for twelfth grade Advanced Placement English Literature.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}She taught me how to state my thesis clearly and concisely without giving too much away in my first paragraph.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}In one of the later essays I wrote in her class about the issues addressed in the book Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck, her feedback said that my introductory paragraph was strong and provided a very good thesis, but my essay as a whole was lacking a more in-depth look into the assigned prompt.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}I chose, as my topic, to discuss the racial issues that surround the character Crooks in the book and what effect the racism has on him as a person; the thesis basically states that the immense amount of discrimination and verbal hostility that Crooks faces make him feel as though he cannot accomplish anything, and it makes him a cruel person which was a common outcome for African Americans in the 1900s.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}I was able to complete a very good thesis paragraph introducing my topic, but I struggled a bit with the analysis of the topic's presence in the book.

I always wondered to myself if there was such a thing as a "good writer"? My main focus in writing has been having a strong thesis statement. I always thought this is important because if you have a terrible thesis statement, then your paper will be unstable. By having a clear thesis statement, the reader will be able to see things from many perspectives with an open mind and see the bigger picture. There are many stages of a developing academic writer. When I was younger, I used to copy words from handy resources like books and posters. My English teacher freshman year gave us a prompt, and, in this prompt, it said, "Suppose you had the opportunity to travel anywhere you wanted. Write to explain where you would go and why." My first thought was, "Let me use my resources." So, I went on the Internet and I checked the best places to travel to. After my teacher read the essay, he said, "This is a nice essay, but in the near future I would like to see your own critical perspective." I always tend to summarize in my essays, and I don't use my own thoughts. As the years went by, I wanted to find a way in order for my essays to improve. Going forward I would like to use my own critical perspective and not rely on research sources. As for my essays go, I will avoid summarizing and instead, I will use my own creativity. I rely too much on my resources instead of thinking critically. I will use my own examples, and this will develop a positive attitude toward my writing skills. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Bradley Drubych ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Throughout my experience in writing, expressing a well-written introduction is important. In school, I challenged the International Baccalaureate program. This opened a new way of learning for all of the students who decided to take on the program. I was given a theory of knowledge class in addition to the two-year literature course. Both classes touched around the topic of introduction but the theory of knowledge class went into depth. As the class went on for the junior and senior year, I learned many new techniques about bettering my skills on writing an introduction. I am confident in my ability to catch the reader's attention with the first couple of lines in the intro. After this, I will introduce a question followed by a thesis statement. An example of this would be, " Perception became my reality in 6th grade when I came to the realization that I wasn\'t seen as the person I thought I was." This is my revised version of an essay I wrote senior year. The paper opens up with a hook line and then is followed by a question, then my thesis. " What defines us? Our physicality, or what\'s inside? We are taught not to judge by someone\'s outside, but to consider what\'s within." I originally had a question at the start but my teacher revised it by having me switch up the order of the intro.\ With my time here at Geneseo, I would like to focus on my punctuation within my writing. I want to explore different options on what types of punctuation I can use. In addition to this, when to use the correct punctuation in the right places. I feel this will help me become more confident as a writer. 288 ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: William Dungate ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Whenever I am either revising or editing, I find myself consistently focusing on my sentence structure and grammar. Throughout high school, I found myself working with a variety of different essay topics and writing styles. While my tone and voice changed constantly with all of these prompts, I still ended up keeping a consistent sentence structure and grammar style (unless directed to do otherwise). I feel as if this skill allows my writing to hold more credibility with the reader, where my thoughts are laid out clearly through proper grammar and well-produced sentences. I believe this skill also allows me to naturally produce different and new ideas, because I am able to read my sentences to myself with less hesitation, permitting my thoughts to flow more. I began to hone on and enhance this skill in my 11^th^ grade AP English class. Before we began writing essays in class, my teacher would give the class packets of work that practiced complex grammar and sentence skills, and spoke to me individually, showing me how to incorporate these skills into my writing. After consistent practice and focusing on such concepts, I was able to change potentially boring, awkward sounding sentences into cleaner, more interesting sentences. For example, a sentence may have sound something like, "The Eyes of Eckleberg symbolize God and how there is no good left in American society". However, after focusing on my structure and revising, I can turn it into something like this, "The lack of God or any good in 1920s American society is represented through the author's use of the Eyes of Eckleberg being left in a deteriorated state". These skills allow me to broaden my claims while also keeping my key points precise. A skill that I hope to improve in my writing is the ability to connect relevant details to the proper key points. At times, the reasons I lost points on essays in high school was due to bringing irrelevant or tangential details to my essay. I hope to be able to determine where to cut off external and pointless details in my writing. Perhaps I could make a planning sheet before essays that discusses details and how I can use them to further my essay, rather than hinder it. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hannah Dwyer ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Hannah Dwyer September 4, 2019 Reflection Paper One In my essays, I focus mostly on my transition words and phrases. I believe essays should flow smoothly, and transitions in between paragraphs and sentences allow that to occur. To add to this, it is also important to use sophisticated language to make my writing piece more interesting. Transition words that are sophisticated are important to add throughout each part of the writing piece. In my past writings I have said, "Social media can have a negative impact on teenagers' social interactions. However, social media can actually connect people by giving them the chance to connect with others no matter the distance." With this type of situation, I can use transition words to show a counter argument and clearly show the opposing side. Also, I use transitions when quoting authors and citing sources so there is a smooth transformation between the citations and my own ideas. Transition words or phrases make the writing piece flow better and can be added anywhere throughout the piece. My teachers helped me learn that transitions are an important aspect and skill needed in a good paper. They taught me that without these transitions the paper would be dull and hard to read. I strongly believe every writer has room for improvement. I think I need to work on making my sentences less wordy. If a sentence is less wordy, it makes the essay easy to understand, read, and flows well. Furthermore, I have room for improvement on balancing the number of quotes, and my own opinions. I tend to use either too many quotes, or too few and I realize that balance can be challenging for any writer. In conclusion, I think my transition words and phrases can be strong and I can give a strong hook, however, I need to learn to balance my writing and make my sentences less repetitive. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kate Dwyer ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a student I feel that I focus well on developing an argument in an argumentative essay. I am able to develop my argument by confirming my position and and building my case with information provided to me. I feel that argumentative writing skills are important because argumentative writing allows for the author to create a connection with the audience because the argument tend to appeal to our common sense and rational thinking. As the author you can control what concrete information you provide. The power to manipulate the argument allows for a successful argument. My AP English teacher provided me with an argumentative writing template that allowed me to find a set structure in my writing. The template taught me how to incorporate reason, such as inductive and deductive reasoning. The template also taught me how to include ethics and emotion. The template taught you how to properly cite your sources as well because you do not want your reader to question your credibility. The template provided to me also talked about being discreet with emotions because you do not want to establish a sense of mistrust with the audience. An argumentative essay also wants to start off with a strong hook. An example of such is, "Perspective alters opinions, and opinions may interfere with one\'s actions which could hinder fate." I felt that this opener sparks a sense of curiosity in the reader. They may ask themselves, "could fate be a theme in the argument?" A good hook will make your reader question what is to come next. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I feel that argumentative writing skills are crucial in becoming a successful writer. In order to improve my skills as a writer, I feel that I should focus more on citing more sources that will provide to my readers that my work can be considered credible. I feel that I am able to interpret a source well, but I struggle to explore the deeper meaning of the argument. I feel I need to also develop better analyzation skills. I want to be able to explore all the realms of an argument. I feel that the way I analyze may seem superficial. In order to create a deeper understanding of an argument, I want to be able to cite outside resources to make it seem as if I have background knowledge about the argument. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Karina Dykeman ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I focus most on figurative language and metaphor. Though it has gotten me into trouble when my point became unclear because of my convoluted and, usually, wordy sentences. I understand that writing well and clearly is important as well, as it's how we communicate and pass on ideas, but my mind runs on a different plane and causes some jumbled and rarely related thoughts to dribble onto the page. In my senior research paper, I was able to choose an in-depth topic from one of many Science Fiction books that I had read that year, and I chose Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein*. My goal was to prove whether or not it was plausible to recreate Victor's famous monster on any front. I used flowery words to shape my narrative of humanity's desire to find immortality and to reverse death. For example, I referenced the civilizations of old and described them as slaves "trying to create a magic cure from reality," followed shortly by a line that pointed out the irony of what they created in the process. I then appraised alchemy for "not just being the ramblings of delirious loons, but a legitimate outcry for the unattainable\[immortality\]." Ordinarily, using common language would suffice for writing an educational paper, but I enjoy playing with the English language and subtly showing off my vast vocabulary. I have, however, been told in the past that I tend to ramble both in speech and writing, so I've tried my best to get to my main point as quickly as possible. It was primarily in my junior year when I ran into trouble with this; my AP English teacher was a paradigm of figurative and flowery language; therefore, she knew how to write better than me. That teacher made me want to write like her, just as Fitzgerald long ago had made me wish to live in the ethereal dream world of *The Great Gatsby*. No other teacher had inspired me to change my writing style except her, so I appreciate her immensely. Writing has been a passion of mine for many years now, I want to be as concise and structured as I can without being repetitive or confusing. I must also add that I have been heavily influenced by the more classical writers like Dostoyevsky and Austen, as two individuals of great skill, I aspire to hold some of the glory for myself and bring joy to other readers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Peter Dyson ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I try to focus on my diction, making my words less plainspoken. Using higher level language demonstrates my ability to refrain from employing less descriptive wording and getting straight to my point. English teachers throughout high school have helped and supported me in my writing process. They have encouraged me to use online resources and thesauruses for the betterment of my word choice, language and writing overall. It has become so much more sophisticated over the years and I attribute that to my wonderful and supportive teachers. For example, I used to use generalizations like "bad" or "great" but now I use more specific words. I wrote an application for a program at another college, when I was applying, about what my dream job would be if I could do research in the field. I started my paper off with, "I have wanted to teach for years now, but if I had sufficient time and funding, I would want to research and document the lives of people fleeing war torn nations". The language I use is much more descriptive than what I would have written in the past. My writing career has been a roller coaster, but my vocabulary and word choice has only improved. There are things that I still need to work on. In the future, I'd like to ensure that I use quotes where they are most effective in my academic papers. I had the habit of using drop quotes or placing them in awkward positions in the sentence. Even though I would explain the quote and what it means in relation to my writing, when reading it for the first time it feels a little choppy, hard to follow, and out of place. I need to make sure I can connect the quotes I'm choosing to use back to my original point much more smoothly and succinctly. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Luca Dzikowski ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I tend to focus on and prioritize the flow of my writing because I feel that if a piece reads fluidly then the reader will remain engaged throughout. The flow of a piece has always been the most important aspect of effective writing to me; I grew up reading books, it was how I spent almost all of my free time, and I believe that facet of my life has influenced my writing greatly. I truly dislike reading pieces that do not transition well, or overuse sophisticated vocabulary that clearly are not efficiently communicating the author's thoughts; and I feel as though my AP English Language and Composition teacher, Ms. Visbal had a lot to do with that. She taught me the importance of maintaining a well thought out and fluid voice throughout all my pieces and highlighted the importance of staying true to my voice as a writer. An example of my focus on flow would be a revision from something like, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Ronald Reagan was quick to expand on Nixon's policies, his presidency, as described on DrugPolicy.org, had "marked the start of a long period of skyrocketing rates of incarceration," it also was the beginning of million dollar budget allocations that would help fight the war on drugs.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[" to something more along the lines of, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Ronald Reagan was quick to expand on Nixon's policies, his presidency "marked the start of a long period of skyrocketing rates of incarceration," (DrugPolicy.org) and budget allocations intended to fuel the war on drugs.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[" ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I develop my writing further at Geneseo I would like to focus on understanding effective fundamental structures of paragraphs and essays, as well as develop an eye for conciseness. I tend to struggle with forming structurally sound pieces because I find it difficult to efficiently incorporate all aspects of my argument in a logical order. I constantly find myself having run in circles or droned on about only a single part of my argument. Therefore understanding structure and honing my ability to remain concise would, I believe, be the next step in improving my academic writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rachel Echols =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus most on sentence construction because that\'s how I establish not only grabbing intros and bodies, but also an invigorating writing flow that I can get lost in. I think it's important to be able to get lost in my writing because it conveys how genuinely I write and that I'm writing my true thoughts. It\'s also important because readers won\'t enjoy, or want to keep reading, if they are bored. Furthermore, I won't enjoy writing if I am boring myself; to bore yourself in an activity you like to do is a pure shame. I like to believe I can always improve, while also keeping the joy in writing. The way a sentence is constructed holds so much power. It can set the mood, add suspense, or just turn a sentence into the same sentence, but conveyed better. Prior English teachers also molded who I am as a writer. They encouraged my preference to get lost in my writing and clean it up after. They made me more aware of how to organize my arguments as well as liven up my vocabulary when there is a word limit. For example, it would be better to say "prior English teachers..." instead of "other people such as my old English teachers...". I love to learn and improve. I'm also aware that I have much to improve on. One area I would like to improve on is my syntax. I am good with basics, but could use more practice as I delve further into the deep pit that syntax is, in this ever expanding writing world. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Dayna Edgett ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Dayna Edgett When I write I want to focus on developing a well-organized introduction paragraph and thesis. This skill is important because it introduces to the reader what the essay or writing will be about. This provides the reader to have the option to continue to read or stop reading depending on what the essay will be about according to the thesis. When writers don't have an organized introduction paragraph, they could possibly lose the audience. In the last few high school essays I wrote, my teacher would mark up my introduction paragraph and give me suggestions on how to organize it. When she would do this, I would work with her to revise it. I would always appreciate the comments my teacher would make on my papers because it would make me realize the mistakes I made and make me a better writer. Especially when our class would practice for the AP Exam. "...analyze how the author portrays the complex experience of two sisters, Penelope and Irene, within their family and society. You may wish to consider such literary elements as style, tone, and selection of detail". This was one of the prompts we had to use in the 2019 AP Lit exam. During this time, we would go over how to identify the hidden question in a writing prompt. The last few essays prompts I would struggle to find the hidden question which would affect how I would develop my thesis. Before working with my high school teacher, I was not able to identify the hidden question which later made my thesis statements unorganized. During my experiences at Suny Geneseo I hope to develop the general writing skills that will help me develop any kind of organized essay. This way when readers read my work, they will have a clear idea on what they are about to read. With a well-developed thesis it will make inserting quotes and explaining evidence in detail much earlier. The structure of the thesis is everything one needs to write an essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kelly Edmond ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Over the summer, I wrote a research paper about mental illness and the stigma surrounding having a mental illness. When writing that paper, I focused on critically analysing scholarly articles that supported my thesis. Being that mental health can be a very general topic, searching for sources that satisfied me, took longer than usual. When writing my research paper, it was important that I had reliable sources that supported my argument. Having strong evidence in my writing made my argument stronger and more persuasive but being able to thoroughly analyse the evidence used, personalized my essay. I\'m fairly confident that I can achieve valid analysis when I clearly understand the text. My mom knows this is not my strong area so she gives me tips such as reading carefully and at a steady pace, annotating, and looking for synonyms for words. These tips encourage me to take my time to break down a text. An example of a text I had to break down in order to make a clear and thoughtful anaysis is when I quoted "People who experienced discrimination from friends and family had reduced access to social capital from these social groups\..." (M. Webber et. Al, 2014) I first had to annotate this sentence then look up the term 'social capital'. I then came up with this analysis; "Social capital generally refers to the value that comes from social networks, that allow individuals to accomplish things they could not do on your own."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I would like to find more techniques that will help me to understand and deeply analyse texts.

I can admit that sometimes when I write I include unnecessary details simply because I find them interesting, which can be distracting to main focus of the writing as a whole. I feel that being detail-oriented leads to a very coherent essay. I developed this skill throughout high school from my English teacher, Mr. Carlson. He was my tenth-grade honors English teacher and my senior AP Literature teacher as well; he was very strict about including concrete evidence and liked an abundance of examples which led to me over compensating on some occasions to make sure I hit the brief of the assignments. An example of this is in my Adrienne Rich biography "Arnold kept a personal library from before Adrienne was born and it included the works of Ibsen, Arnold. Blake, and Keats." Revising this now I can see that although an interesting fact it was irrelevant to the work as a whole. In my future writing I hope to improve on word selection, I feel that an educated reader is more inclined to read and understand your work if you use more sophisticated language. I realize one of my faults is I tend to use a more simplified vocabulary because I prefer to read that myself. I feel that with a better vocabulary I can step up my writing to satisfy not only the demands of college but also that of the real world. I believe that becoming educated is very important and that my language should reflect my same beliefs. I love to develop new skills and enjoy a challenge. I can work on my faults by revising my examples after I finish writing and by actively trying to enhance my vocabulary on my own. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jakob Ellithorpe ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing academic pieces I like to focus on the audience\'s thoughts, I am referring to counter-arguments. When writing an academic piece of writing whether it be a research paper or a persuasive piece of writing. Identifying the opposition and what others might say or think is the strongest thing you can do as a writer. This tells your reader you\'re thinking about others and their viewpoint. It will also make your main themes and points even stronger. There are many ways I present the opposition or what others would say. For example, I use phrases or sentences, such as "Conventional wisdom has it that..." or, "The standard way of thinking about topic X has it that..." I use phrases like this to introduce the opposition and the phrase allows me to refute and support my view or position. This is the most effective way. I learned a lot about this through a book called "They Say, I Say", which I read my senior year of high school. When writing I like to present the opposition to make my points stronger in the eyes of the reader.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward I want to focus on developing effective conclusions to my writing pieces. The closing to a story or narrative is so important because it should leave the reader in a full understanding of the writing piece. It should also be leaving readers saying "That was a great ending" or "Wow that makes a lot of sense." At the end of INTD 106, I want to master the skill of developing an effective and memorable conclusion to all of my writing pieces. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jalen Mark Elmaliki ================================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I tend to believe that the context behind a thesis is arguably one of the most critical aspects of academic writing. Without the background information, it would make it hard to understand the argument better. Whenever possible, I try to introduce the background information behind an essay as clearly as possible. If a reader doesn't understand the context behind an argument, it would be unlikely that they would be able to understand why the debate exists in the first place. However, this wasn't always the case. When I was a sophomore in high school, I used to take writing a concise introduction for granted. That was until my English 10 teacher noticed I was struggling with writing introductions. She gave me an outline that I still apply to my writing today. It helped me better understand the importance of the context of an argument in an essay and allowed me to become more evident in my writing. In the middle of my second year, I applied this outline to a paper I had to resubmit. In the original draft, my work was lazy and sloppy, which made the piece seem basic and boring. "One form is ethnic discrimination, that affects and affected many ethnicities within the US. Ethnic discrimination is discrimination based on one's ethnicity." As you can see from the previous quote, I didn't care about making an introduction. Little did I know, this laziness damaged my thesis. Compare that to my revised essay: "One form is ethnic discrimination, such as discrimination against French-Canadians\... \... This is becoming more of a pressing issue, considering Quebec's increasing want for independence." The revised version of my essay was more effective in supporting my thesis and drawing the reader in than my unedited version. It was better because it is more specific and addresses why this issue is significant. In my college career, I would like to focus on using other citation formats and using better citation in general. In high school, I only used MLA formatting, so I think it would be beneficial for me to learn how to cite in other formats quickly. Also considering that throughout the later years of high school, I focused on writing narratives, I would like to refresh my understanding of citing work and doing research in general. I feel that would help me become a better academic writer and avoid any accidental plagiarism. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Delaney Emerson ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing anything I focus on making things short and to the point. I tend to repeat things in different ways. This information is not needed to obtain the point. I have received a lot of feedback from my teachers in high school about cutting out the repeated information in my writing. Once the readers sees that the information is repeated they do not want to read any further. In my college essay I wrote this \" It was youth weekend, and I was out hunting with my dad. Youth weekend is when youth hunters get to hunt with a gun the weekend before the regular gun season opens.\" In this example the explanation of youth weekend it is not needed. By giving the reader this information does not change the main idea. When my business writing teacher pulled me aside to tell me I did not need to explain what youth weekend was I asked her what if the person reading it has no idea about hunting and she told me \" the reader does not need to know what exactly it is, to see what the story is about.\" The importance of mastering this skill will help when I have a paper that needs to be under a certain amount of words so I can include all the main ideas and make it more to the point. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When thinking of what I need to develop in my writing is my introductions and conclusions, I need to get the reader\'s attention to bring them into the writing but also not close the writing in a lame way like \"Now you can see or hence this is why I believe this\" I have struggled with this for a while and during high school received help from my teachers and it did help me but I am still not completely confident in this area but I really want to become confident when writing introductions and conclusions.

If an assignment is unorganized and jumping from one idea to the next it can be very difficult for the reader to follow those ideas and understand them clearly. In high school, my English teacher saw that I lacked organization in many of my writing assignments and wanted to help me. She showed me how to organize my thoughts before I started to write by making a template for myself based on my assignment. The template would include the ideas I must include in the assignment, what I want to include in the assignment and in what order I should do so. For example, in my college essay, I wrote about Camp ANCHOR, which is a summer camp for children and adults with special needs I volunteered at throughout high school and used the template to help organize my thoughts. I used the template to organize my ideas between the two different summers I volunteered at the camp. For example, I started talking about my first summer of camp by saying, "I was really nervous about camp; I had never spent much time with children or adults with disabilities, and I didn't know what to expect.". I then spoke about how I loved my first summer at Camp ANCHOR and ended up going back again the next summer. I also included how different my second summer was then my first by saying, "Senior 7 was an all-girl group with campers ages eighteen to thirty with a variety of disabilities. This group was the complete opposite of Junior 8 but I was up for the challenge.". By using the template I had made I was able to express my ideas from two separate summers clearly. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In future writing assignments, I would like to focus on my grammatical skills. I tend to write very quickly and end up with many unnecessary grammatical errors. Along with that, I still continue to struggle with the placement of commas and semicolons. I would also like to broaden my vocabulary.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Todd Everts ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Transitioning from high school writing towards college writing was a huge step in my academic career as I felt that high schools' workload and requirements are nothing compared to what I've been experienced so far. As I write essays one piece of academic writing, I already focus on would be the length of my paper. What I mean by that is that I was my paper to be filled with knowledgeable facts backed up by hardy resources. The problem to this is that I tend to skip topics and either overuse one word or underuse another. This has led to a lot of organizational problems which I am used to fixing during revision part of the draft. One aspect of academic writing I wish to fix would be incorporating quotes. I tend to use quotes mainly when I either quote some one or use it as evidence to back up my claim. One example of this would be using words such as "they said" or "as previously stated". Yet this may appeal towards high school writers, this use of incorporating disrupts the flow of the argument. Instead I should make it flow as I blend in the quotes "by making them sound one" with the argument. What this will do is create a more unified writing between the narrator and other authors as you create both piece of works into one. In conclusion there are many things that set apart college writing and high school writing, whether that be the use of certain vocabulary or the length of one's work. What I hope to accomplish over my next four years at Geneseo will be the understand the college conventions of writing better as well as become an overall well-rounded problem solver and critical thinker. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christina Faber ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Christina Faber]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [September 5, 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Reflecting on my academic writing, I realize that I am able to be clear and concise in both my introduction and conclusion. This was a long learned skill, and it took me most of high school to finally feel confident with beginning and concluding an essay. I took two english courses both junior and senior year, so I believe that the constant production of essays and assignments forced myself to become a better messenger of my words to the page. I noticed that my introductions became more tight, and my conclusions never introduced new information. For example, this is an introduction for an essay I wrote my senior year: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["In ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ by Tom Stoppard, Ros and Guil face the existential fear that their individual lives have no specific purpose. Stoppard uses traditional literary elements (such as setting and motif) and elements specific to drama (such as stage direction and breaking the fourth wall) in order to illustrate the character's feelings and worries when it comes to the true meaning of their lives."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [This introduction is short, concise, and contains only the necessary information the reader needs to begin the essay. The thesis is stated, and the introduction indicates what I will continue to talk about later in my essay. To be able to craft clean introductions and conclusions for essays is so important. The essay's introduction is the first impression of the piece of writing, and sets the tone for the rest of the piece.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Although my introduction and conclusion are effective, I tend to write more in the body paragraphs of essays than I need to. Not in a good way, where the reader is left with plenty of information to decipher: rather, in a way where the most important points I am trying to make are drowned out by content that has little to do with the subject of the essay. I sometimes add a lot of fluff to my writing in order to drown out the point that I may be unconfident in what I'm writing about. This is what I want to develop effectively; being able to write a clear and concise full essay that is easy to follow and understand.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Word Count: 369]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Miranda Fanara ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} While writing, I focus mostly on getting rid of unnecessary words from my first draft to make sure my point comes across clearly and precisely. If an essay has too many unnecessary words within its writing, its message may be lost along the way and the reader may not understand what I am writing. My english teacher in twelfth grade taught our class how to eliminate unnecessary words and replace them with strong verbs instead, especially the word "is." For example, in a research essay I wrote in high school about animal cruelty I had wrote "Animals love their owners more than they can show, but some owners choose to neglect their love and treat their pets with disrespect." Although that sentence may make sense, I changed it in order to give the sentence more life and make the sentence more precise\-- "The love of animals proves to be unconditional, however many owners continue to treat their pets with disrespect." I am confident that I can improve essays through revising word choice throughout to make my writing more clear and concise. In the future, I would like to focus on improving my writing from the first perspective. I haven't had much experience writing papers from my point of view, but I am now, and I have in INTD 105 as well. I'd like to especially focus on eliminating unwanted pronouns and allowing my first person writing to shine alongside my essays written in the third person. In order to accomplish my goal, I could practice writing in the first person more often and look up tips on improving my writing in that regard. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicolette Farago ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I tend to put stress on engaging an audience. I try to paint a beautiful image in the reader's mind that allows for immersion into the text without leaving a stale taste behind. When the work doesn't engage a reader, it can create a negative impression of the author's point no matter how well-developed it is. In my high school, there was an English teacher I found to be my personal favorite. This was because he taught me how to capture the attention of someone through my writing. He taught me the nuances of simile and metaphor, how to liken one topic to another so people outside the work could relate to it and better understand the connotations of the piece. For my college admission essay, I wrote about embroidery. In that piece, it was essential to convey the aspects of the topic with the proper tone and emotion. I likened losing an embroidery needle to children's games, Where's Waldo and The Floor is Lava, that most people would recognize almost instantly. This technique is effective because the comparison will, if done well, create a similar mood that makes the point of the piece much clearer. Because of the comparison that is made a reader who has never experienced dropping a needle can grasp precisely how it feels to me when I do. Writing is an essential skill that I've been working both passively and actively to develop mastery over for several years. I'm still not perfect, and more likely than not I never will be. I enjoy learning and honing my craft, and there are still plenty of things I need to work on. I feel that I still need to learn how to write more simply so that my work is understandable to a broader audience. (301 words) ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joshua Farmer =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write the main thing that I like to focus on is making sure that my thesis statement in my introduction is very clear and understandable and that the topic sentences always refer back to the thesis itself. The thesis sets the tone for the rest of the essay and really expresses where I as a writer stand for the prompt that was given and the topic sentences consistently support my thesis. Over the years, I've grown in this aspect of my writing thanks to structured outline for essays that my AP U.S. History teacher taught me back in 11^th^ grade. His general outline helped me to not get off track and to make sure that I had a strong stance that the reader will be able to remember as the essays progressed. One terrific example would be that I replace saying " There are similarities regarding the development of society within different colonial regions in British North America from 1607 to 1700\". To something more precise like, \"There are similarities to a great extent with a[ll colonial regions dealt with conflicts, developed early governments, needed slavery for their society to flourish, and mercantilism was the basis for their economic life.\" ". From there I will make my supporting detailed paragraphs into these topics to tie back in directly with the strong and easily understood thesis. ]{style="color: black;"}[Learning this very efficient concept from my 11th grade ]{style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;"}[AP U.S. History teacher was very helpful but I am always willing to learn more and grow to become the best writer I can be.]{style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 1rem;"} Furthermore, I could also focus more on my sentence structure. I feel as if some of my sentences may run on for too long or they could more efficiently be divided. This can be done with useful punctuation like semi colons, commas, dashes, hyphens and more. With improving this, I will show maturity in my writing and really express my ideas to it's fullest potential here at SUNY Geneseo. Go knights!! ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Annabelle Farrell =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Annabelle Farrell INTD 106 9/5/19 One aspect of academic writing on which I consciously focus as I revise my drafts is making sure that my ideas are concentrated and organized in the different sections of the piece that I am writing. I believe that organization in academic writing is extremely important because well thought out ideas can become lost in an unorganized piece of writing if readers are not able to locate important aspects of the piece such as the thesis statement. An instance in which I strengthened my ability for the organization of ideas was last year when I brought an essay into the Writing Learning Center here at Geneseo. While there, the tutor with whom I worked helped me to organize my many ideas into concrete and distinct paragraphs. The piece that I brought into the Writing Learning Center was about the role of women during the Middle Ages. I no longer have this paper, but to paraphrase my initial thesis statement, the structure of the paper centered around the few specific historical figures whom I had researched. The tutor at the Writing Learning Center then helped me to organize my thesis and therefore my entire essay into describing the different roles that women played during that time period. Because of this help, the quality of my paper drastically increased as it became both easier to read and easier to understand as the reader would now be able to follow the ideas that I presented. Conversely, one aspect of academic writing that I plan to develop effectively through taking this course is the ability to effectively summarize my ideas. I believe that this is important because an effective summary can be used to create both a compelling thesis statement and a memorable conclusion without which, a piece of academic writing has nearly no impact on its readers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Fasulo ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Emily Fasulo]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD-106-01]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Due: September 5th, 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Throughout high school, I was often faced with many different styles of writing all requiring different reasons for each one. However, as I continued to write I began to grow more and more passionate about the idea of writing. Therefore, while it is not always considered a skill used in writing, the care and passion I put into a majority of my works are definitely one of my better skill sets. While that is one of my strongest assets to bring into any writing I have always had a few skills that mainly naturally developed. Last year, I was in a similar writing course where my teacher often discussed how people would write using the incorrect voice and while I never understood what she meant by this, she would often tell me I did an excellent job using an active voice while I write. Soon after, I finally learned what she meant in regard to these terms and found this form of writing to be second nature. This can be found in many of my high school writings such as, "Poe continued to use the death of beautiful women to express the extreme loss he continued to face throughout his life". I can clearly understand why this skill is so important as using active voice helps convey a clear message, while the passive voice makes it almost pseudo-intelligent and clunky. While this skill came quite naturally to me, there are still many aspects of writing I struggle with daily.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While the form and passion have always been a strong foundation for my writing the real skills tend to be lacking. My use and understanding of grammar have always been less than. All throughout high school, many teachers would try and help me develop proper sentence structures, use of commas, etc. however, I have had significant trouble trying to retain the information. One example of this is, "Andrew Jackson was good at being possibly the worst president of all time". Throughout this course, I plan on focusing more on the concrete of writing rather than the passion to fine-tune a skill I not only thoroughly enjoy, but will need throughout my life and profession.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katie Feeley ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [While I am writing one aspect I focus on the most is staying on topic throughout the whole paper. While I was writing a paper in my junior year of high school about how electronics changed our world I was told by my English teacher that I would sometimes drift off and not talk about the main points of the essay. One sentence I wrote was about transportation and how cars have changed our world. With that being said my teacher explained to me how that was not what I was supposed to be talking about. Therefore I had to delete the sentence and get back on topic and talk about electronics and how phones have changed our world. I worked hard on changing that and by the time I was in my senior year and had to write my research paper I was fully prepared and received an outstanding grade. I would not have been able to do that without my teacher that was dedicated to helping me and wanted to see my succeed. This is an important aspect of writing for multiple reasons. If you talk about anything else but what you are supposed to the paper is useless. No one wants to read a piece of writing that is all over the place. It can be very confusing and can give out the wrong message on what you are supposed to be talking about. Therefore I focus on that tremendously and as I proof read my papers I always make sure I stay on topic. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue to advance my writing skills I need to work on expanding my vocabulary. I believe that using different words makes your paper better and keeps the reader interested to continue reading. The language you use while writing can deliver different messages to the reader. Therefore as I continue my education at Geneseo I will work hard in each of my papers to excel in my writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sean Finucane =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Self Reflection \#1 Sean Finucane\ 9/4/19\ I like to focus on establishing a good thesis when I write a research paper or essay because I feel it\'s important to explain to the reader what argument you are trying to convey in your writing piece. If I were to write a poor thesis in the introduction of my paper, the information in the following paragraphs wouldn\'t be clear or make any sense. My papers are more effective when I write a strong, detailed thesis. Also, thesis' are important because they help set the tone for the rest of your paper. In my junior year, my APUSH class was doing a research paper on any historical event that occured in the world that in some way affected the United States. The event could only be after 1960. I decided to write my paper on the United States' war on drugs in South America. My teacher gave us several months to complete the paper, however he wanted us to have a thesis by the following week. At the time, I hated writing thesis'. I never knew if\ I was backing up my claim effectively or not. However, I went to my teacher and he helped me through the whole process. He helped me to write a thesis that not only made a strong argument on why the United States had to act on the drug smuggling in South America, but also explained how their intervention would shape Today's society. The thesis was The United States' war on drugs in South America helped to stop the smuggling of drugs by creating the DEA, enforcing stricter border laws, and making new government policy on drugs. However, my writing is not perfect.I have flaws like every other human being. One area that I need to work on and develop is my research or evidence in a paper. I tend to repeat myself when writing an essay or research paper because my mind sometimes blanks and i forget what evidence I need in a certain paragraph. Also, I try not to repeat the same piece of evidence more than twice, including a thesis, introduction, or conclusion. I hope by taking this class I can enhance my writing skills and become a better writer in the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Caroline Fitzgerald ================================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I believe it is important to introduce, cite and explain quotes when using them in a paper. It suggests that a student is sloppy and unprofessional when direct quotes from another text are inserted directly into a paper without any context or explanation. Whether it be a research paper, an analysis of a piece of literature, or another kind of written assignment, quotes from other sources must be inserted into the paper using the introduce, cite and explain method. In my twelfth grade IB Language and Literature class, my teacher called this strategy "ICE," and my classmates and I found it very helpful. I can reference an example in a paper I wrote analyzing Amy Chua's memoir entitled ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. I wrote, "Chua allows her youngest daughter, Lulu, not only to quit playing the violin but to take up a sport. She writes, 'I couldn't lose Lulu. Nothing was more important. So I did the most Western thing imaginable and gave her the choice' (Chua). Chua's switch from choosing her daughter's activities for her to allowing her to pursue her own hobbies shows how she evolves as a parent throughout the story." In this excerpt from my essay, I included a quote and thoroughly explained it with information regarding the context as well as the way it pertains to the memoir as a whole. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In future writing assignments, I would like to try to use a less repetitive sentence structure. I tend to use too many simple sentence structures and would like to add more complexity. Additionally, I would like to vary the way I start sentences. I feel as though writing sounds better when sentence structure is varied, as it makes it more interesting and captivating.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(291 words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Destiny FitzGerald ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} \ One aspect of my writing that I consciously focus on is maintaining my thesis statement and referring to the main point of my writing throughout my paper. This is an important skill to posses when writing because it allows me to portray a strong sense of my topic and be able to get my point across to any audience. This is also important because my writings are always very clear and precise, which makes reading my work easy. I have acquired this skill from using resources like my summer professor Mr. Tsang, my honors English teacher, and the online writing website Owl Purdue. Each of these people/websites have helped shape this skill by teaching me it's importance and commenting on my work when I started to get off track or start losing the main idea of my paper. Through doing that, this has caused me to keep that point in the back of my mind whenever writing a paper. I am happy that I have been able to make this a habit because it is something, I will need all throughout my college career. An example of maintaining my thesis throughout a paper can e seen in my most recent writing on discrimination, "Furthermore, the added number of stressors piled onto the LGBTQ+ community can make the members more susceptible to obtaining a mental disorder" (FitzGerald, 2019, p.3) or "When a person discredits another individual for being a part of the LGBTQ+ community it can bring on mental disorders that can threaten a person's life" (FitzGerald, 2019,p. 6). I always make sure to tie in my thesis with every example I use.\ A writing skill I would like to develop or enhance going forward would be the use of transition words and transitioning between paragraphs. I noticed that sometimes in my writing I will jump from one point to another with a rough transition or no transition at all. Some possible solutions to this problem would be to use my resources wisely and refer to the book called "They Say I Say". This book was introduced to me in my INTD 170 class in a summer program I attended. By referring to this book I will be able to use templates to introduce quotes and transition between ideas in a paper. Another tactic would be to have my writings checked for any rough transitions. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Allison Flanagan ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Allison Flanagan Dr. Paku INTD 106-01 5 September 2019 Self Reflection \#1 When I write, I focus greatly on word choice, and how it affects how my point gets across. One strength that I possess in my writing is my use of syntax. Strong syntax is important in writing because it helps the piece become easier to understand. It helps the writer get his or her point across clearly, which is essential to establish full understanding of the text. In my junior year of high school, I had to write a research reflection after reading *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest* for my English class. Everyone chose a research topic that correlated with the book, and wrote a reflection connecting the book to their topic of choice. I chose to further investigate the stigma of mental illness. An example of strong syntax that I used in this piece is presented when I discussed a lie that a doctor in the book told to make people less fearful, and that further stigmatized mental illness. I stated that the doctor's "lie was more harmful than the truth- the fact that he had to state that the patients were just workers made them feel less human, and further stigmatized mental illness." My English teacher that year helped me greatly with my word choice in my writing to help it flow easier. I believe that syntax is a very important part of strong writing. Although syntax is one of my strengths, I also have weaknesses in my writing. One weakness that I possess is that I have trouble fully developing my points. I'll have a great idea in my head, but once I put pen to paper, my idea is not as prominent. For example, I'll make a point about "white representing purity and innocence," but I will not connect it back to the text, or dig deeper in the analysis. I have a hard time writing my complete ideas on paper. Overall, I am hoping that this class will help me become a better writer by correcting my mistakes, and strengthening the skills that I already have. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sierra Flores =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing I have found that more often than not, I'm constantly revising sentences that seem to sound more like a conversation than a written work. It's not that I don't know the proper grammar to use, or that I don't understand basic sentence structures, but when I write I think that I make the writing sound like something I would say. I think it's important to have a clear voice in my writing, but this potentially leads to unclear thoughts and sometimes causes issues in my writing. For example, in a piece of writing for an Anthropology course, the professor asked us to reflect on the impact of language on the nature of our upbringing. A note that my professor gave was that I wasn't using words in their proper order or I'd have sentences that ran on for a paragraph. Originally I wrote, "Being born into a half West Indian, half Hispanic household had a huge impact on my language and how I speak, I have been raised pronouncing certain words like my family does, some are pronounced with a Hispanic accent like my dad, and some words are pronounced in a West Indian accent like my mom, being an eighteen year old girl the U.S. is also a way that my language impacts me." Upon revision, this became multiple sentences with well thought out word placement. "Growing up in an immigrant household, language was something that had multiple definitions and views. I felt that I had multiple identities. The family girl that sounded like her mom when she spoke with an accent just like hers. Or like her dad, using Spanish as a mode of communication between the family. Not only at home, I learned a substantial amount about knowledge at school, among my peers.." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I feel that this learning skill has taught me the importance of making my voice heard without making my writing sound "dumbed down" or unclear. I still find myself taking a second or third look at my work just to make sure everything sounds cohesive and coherent. This skill is becoming easier to spot as time goes on. I hope that my writing continues to evolve and specifically, I hope to work on making my writing sound as organized and concise as possible. I think that even after the first few weeks of this semester I have already learned skills to make this easier. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mckenzie Flynn ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I have found that I fell into the terrible habit of writing in simple sentences. When I write, I try to incorporate my voice and how I would say something in person, but not many people can successfully write how they speak and still make it sophisticated. Because of this habit, my writing ends up sounding boring when I go through to revise. I believe my skill is knowing when I can make one of my sentences sound more polished. Over the years, I've had a good amount of help from my mom and my twelfth grade humanities teacher. My mom is a speech pathologist and used to proofread my writing for almost every class (mostly because she caught what I missed when I was in middle school). My humanities teacher sat down with me after I wrote my college essay and helped me revise my sentences from "The sport I ended up playing is probably the hardest out of all the sports I tried," to "Ironically, the sport I ended up pursuing is inarguably more difficult than all the other sports I tried before." Being self-aware and knowing I have to go back to change my underdeveloped vocabulary and language is a skill I consider important. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An area where I need to develop my skills is being crystal clear with what I'm trying to say. I struggle to write a good thesis or a solid explanation because I'm never as concise as I want to be.

Instead of just blatantly stating the concepts I will be including to argue my viewpoint on a specific topic, I ensure to include the importance of the examples and how they make my viewpoint strong. Throughout all of high school this key tool was instilled into me as a writer, especially by my AP English teacher during twelfth grade. I find this is a significant skill because it gives insight into how the examples strengthen my point, instead of the points being listed with no real clear explanation of their purpose in the writing. An example I would elaborate more on would be, "Conrad uses imagery consistently throughout the novel." Instead I would see to be more precise, for example, "In ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Heart of Darknes]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[s, Conrad uses imagery throughout in order to create a sense of looming darkness furthering his idea that imperialism has massive negative effects on the preexisting civilization."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While I am always looking to improve my writing skills, one aspect I would like to focus on is implementing a more varied vocabulary within my writing. I tend to repeat the same bland language and never really push myself to use words I am not accustomed to using.

For example when writing my senior paper this past year I wrote about Antidepressants in children, My point was for the fact that people who need help should get it without staying away because of personal beliefs and what the media portrays to us. I had a very hard time not writing anything about the opposite side of the point when it came to researching facts, such as mentioning that "the age we are giving children medication is lowering" or "It would be better to try to give children therapies while their brains are still developing instead of medications". I spent a lot of time with my teacher before I came to the conclusion that you just can't do that when writing an argument. You are allowed to mention the other point but are not supposed to address information other than on your point.

Creating a paper for a professor who has to read 50 other very similar essays is not an easy task, it is somewhat hard to make your paper memorable. Original language is the key to reaching a successful paper in my opinion. By original I mean making sure you repeat adjectives or verbs as little as possible, by little I mean in the same sentence. I picked up this skill from my high school freshman english teacher Mrs. Liebler, she would always tell me "Cameron, your essays are too repetitive, use new words once in a while!" After that piece of advice that became one of my main goals when writing reports and essays for teachers. In an early draft of my sophomore year research paper, I had the sentence "For us to truly put an end to global warming, we must all come together and realize there's a way to end global warming for good."

Over the summer, I worked on a 10 page paper on colorism and I had help from my professor and the book, They Say, I Say. Within the novel, it had templates to guide me with my research paper. But one thing I notice, I do as well is using more of the quotes from my resources than giving my own opinion as well. For example, in my first paragraph, I wrote more about the examples that I found, "The media has been portraying colorism through movies or TV shows, celebrities, and social media. In movies or TV shows, the lighter-skinned black person is always viewed as a better person than the darker-skinned. For example, the show ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Martin]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ the light-skinned character, Gina, is one of the main characters.

Having a wide variety of vocabulary is a strong asset for myself and any other writer, It makes so the writing piece isn't just one note and makes for a more successful product. Throughout my educational experience I have had many english teachers give me helpful tips and constructive criticism about how to make my writing pieces stand out and how to incorporate stronger vocabulary into my writing. I think the most beneficial criticism I have received is from my senior year english teacher. For example, while writing my college essay I would promulgate to Geneseo, she made me aware of the kind of words I chose to use and how to fit them into sentences that would make my writing valid. One sentence my teacher picked out from my essay was, "These outlets helped me let out my feelings that I was keeping in" (college essay). Instead of just saying " helped me let out my feelings that I was keeping in", she gave me advice on how to lengthen and add more personal details. - "These outlets helped me confront and let out my feelings I was oppressing". As I complete the rest of my academic journey, I hope to strengthen and improve on my ability to source, quote, and give credit to documents and authors correctly and where It is needed.

In doing so, I have encountered the problem of running out of space for the allotted word count or straying away from the main topic. I know that having an excellent ability to create an image with words is useful in writing, but it can hinder my progress from achieving the final product in a paper. If one is not capable of using words to create an image, their works of writing can be very dull and uninteresting to read; I always try to create excitement using vivid words to capture the attention of the reader. In my senior year of high school in Fairport, my English teacher, Mrs. Klein, would always inform me that my documents were \"beautifully written,\" however, they did not touch upon the rubric which was assigned to me. I had stayed after school with Mrs. Klein to address how my writing can improve, considering I was going to head to college in just a few short months. In my essay for my application to the school of education, I stated: \"The amount of enthusiasm and knowledge he possessed of this topic contrived the idea that this is what I want to do with my life.\" I could have simply said, \"He was a good teacher and helped me realize I want to teach.\" Because I am a history major, I will be writing A LOT of papers, and I wanted to be able to create beautifully written pieces while following the desired criteria of my professors. I am now confident that given a rubric to follow, or given a question to answer, I am capable of producing a well-written paper while fulfilling the wants of my instructor. I am always open to criticism as long as it will benefit me in the future; I feel I am relatively easy going and can handle the critiques of my writing. I can then use what I have newly acquired and utilize it in my next paper.\ As I progress in my writing, I wish to work on the ability to create almost \"small arguments\" in my writing. I try to treat each paragraph, or side, of my writing, has its own entity and thinking of it as a separate argument can improve the flow and credibility of my papers.

I think that it is crucial to sound formal to ensure that the professor whom I am writing to feels as though they are receiving the respect that they deserve. It is important that you speak to those of higher authority formally, rather than as if they are one of your friends that you are texting. An example of an email written formally may begin by saying "Dear" or "Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening" and conclude by saying "Thank you". I have received a lot of guidance about this aspect while growing up.

I believe an audience pays more attention to a piece of work that is speaking to them, not one that they are simply reading. While I revise I often read my writing out loud to see if it truly sounds like me. I owe some of my successes with voice to my senior year English teacher. She allowed me to express my voice in even the most formal of writing because she understood that is what I value in literature. She helped me formulate my voice to become more powerful and direct in relation to the message of my writing. For example, she helped me formulate the intro of my graduation speech, my initial draft was redundant repeating the words "together we", she helped me trim it down to three sentences focusing on my point that we grew up together while including my voice to make it sentimental. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My writing is far from perfect and could always use developing, such as my use of diction and proper use of grammar.

The fluffiness that these extra words add to your writing just confuses the reader and takes away from the main focus. This can be done by simply removing extra words that don't add to the overall meaning. For example, in a previous essay I wrote "The level was escalated though when Clinton lied under oath." After having my professor look over this and revising my essay I changed this sentence to "the level was escalated when Clinton lied under oath." This was a very simple change. I only removed one word, but by removing this word I made my writing more towards the point I was trying to make. This suggestion was provided to me by my Humanities professor.

For example, in a research paper about the effects of conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I introduce the topic by saying : "We, as a global society, are in a state of constant growth. This is due to the heightened correspondence between people and nations all around the globe. The best minds and institutions can share information and resources in a swift and efficient manner. As well, large corporations are able to seize natural resources for their industrial use. Despite these advancements, there are still plenty of people and civilizations which are left struggling." The sentiment described in these lines doesn't directly address the topic of conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, however, it does set the tone of the essay. After stating my understanding of the world, I address the topic : "Although the mining industry in the Democratic Republic of Congo has reaped its benefits, there are numerous sources that suggest these industries are contributing to the destruction of Congolese people." I\'ve received mixed criticisms on this approach to academic writing, specifically from my 11th and 12th grade English teachers.

My experiences in writing have taught me that it is not only useful, but vital for a strong essay. With the help of my English teachers in high school, I gained independent understanding that organization provides for clarity and coherence in effective arguments. This was displayed several times when I revised my literary analysis of [The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle]{.underline}. Messy, vague topic sentences like "the author used several literary devices in the process" cluttered my writing and blurred lines between the two elements. To fix this, I meticulously revised by stating clear, blunt topic sentences detailing specific literary devices, such as "proper *word choice* plays a key role in the development of the passage's plot" and "the *narrative pace* accelerates quickly throughout the passage." These sentences paved clear paths for any following evidence so as not to confuse the reader. Developing my skills in word choice and language would serve as a valuable investment of time for the future. I feel as if I sometimes don't use language that correlates with the level of writing expected from me. Working on this could be a challenge, but I believe that I can significantly improve on this skill by evaluating past assignments of mine that attained high marks, and understanding when to use different difficulties of language and when.

When my AP Government teacher reviewed my essays, he would occasionally mark off points because my thesis statement would be too vague or I did not support my thoughts with an example. I improved this skill by doing one question writing quizzes that were timed, which encouraged me to answer questions in a more efficient way. For example, I responded to an essay question by saying "Often times public opinion polls may be bias because they only give the surveys to a small number of people, which can affect how the media covers elections." When my teacher revised it, he suggested that I use a specific example in place of a basic definition.

I love to have a voice that speaks to the reader with colors rather than a dull paper that sounds like it would be read at a business meeting about taxes. An example of a time that my writing stood out was in my senior year of high school when we were given a research paper on the topic of anything we desire. Due to that, I was able to one-hundred percent of my passion into this paper allowing mine to stand out from the rest, and that is exactly what my English teacher told me in my essay ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Why Do We Have Wars]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[.

I learned to focus on this in my tenth grade English class when my teacher explained the importance of good transitions to the flow and readability of a writing piece. She explained that transition phrases can be important to some transitions, especially into new paragraphs and contrasting ideas, however it is necessary to connect ideas in all transitions. This prevents choppy and unorganized writing and too much jumping around, which may confuse the reader. My method of achieving these transitions is generally achieved in the pre-writing phase of a writing piece. When I am getting my ideas down and starting to think about the organization of my paper, I will look for ideas that show similarities and could help bridge the gap between paragraphs. An example of this would be in planning my transition from a paragraph about my background information to a paragraph about my career aspirations. I talked about my interest in chemistry to end my background information and my aspiration to become a chemist to start my career aspiration paragraph. Specifically, to end my background paragraph I said, "In school I loved to challenge myself with AP and honors classes, especially math and chemistry classes." Then I added a transition phrase and began my next paragraph with, "Through chemistry class in high school I learned of astrochemistry, a job which deals with chemical principles in space." While I have some writing strengths, such as transitioning, I recognize that I still have much room for improvement and I am excited to learn and grow in some of my weaker areas such as developing my own ideas and incorporating them into my writing. I believe I could improve in this area by suspending my judgement on the texts I read in order to better analyze opposing viewpoints and understand the strengths and weaknesses of each side of a topic or issue. This would allow me to develop my own thoughts based on ideas that acknowledge both sides of the issue. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: James George ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Writing is a fundamental skill for advancement in society. People with strong writing skills can often be seen in the spotlight as politicians, diplomats, and CEOs. As an avid reader of non-fiction, I often look to others for guidance and inspiration when it comes to my craft and tone. This ability to both learn from others and at the same time contribute to my areas of interest is by far one of my biggest strengths as a writer. One individual who was a great help with this was my mother. My mom has a Masters in Literacy. This has helped me by turning me into a lifelong reader. This gift has allowed me to help myself, grow and challenge conventional norms. When critiquing my own work, I often find that my biggest struggle in writing is both a lack of sentence variety and ineffectively communicating my point. For example, on editing a recent research paper on the struggle for civil rights during the 1920s, I found that the sections of my paper that directly dealt with history and political science were too complex and wordy for my targeted audience. Initially, when writing about the struggle for equality and the role Harding played in it, I said "Warren G. Harding was a man of his time and beyond his time. He was committed to deeds, not words and results over rhetoric. With the help of a massive wave of Republican Congressmen and Senators, Harding used the bully-pulpit to make headway on the race issue. This included advocating for equality in the civil service, anti-lynching legislation and improving the schools of minorities." Although this paragraph works, it ultimately confused some of my friends who were editing for me. In turn, I changed it to a much simpler introduction that said"Appalled by the resurgence of racism in the Progressive Era, Harding fought the racists head-on. His short tenure as president did not enable him to completely solve the race problem but his actions were undeniably laudable." Although it does remove some of the historical context, it is much more presentable and accessible for the average reader. One development, which would make my writings more accessible would be to focus less on content and more on readability. Although I have worked on this in the past, It is still an ongoing battle. By doing this, I can share my love of history with others. When considering where I want to see myself grow as a student at Geneseo, I know that in order to succeed, I must continue to be both intellectually curious and critical of my own work. I feel that all growth comes from when one steps out of their comfort zone. Over the course of my life, my writing has improved dramatically. Even now, as I reflect on past papers, I cannot believe how much my abilities have changed since high school. Although it is impossible to be a "perfect" writer, a growth mindset can change anything. Above all else, I feel that the biggest weakness of my writing is the complexity and lack of sentence variety. By looking to others and writing more, I know that it is well within my power to become a better writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Max Germaine ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Max Germaine As a writer, I keep my introduction short, sweet, and to the point. This helps me keep my ideas together and grab the attention of the reader right away, not lose his/her attention by having long, drawn out introductions incorporating every detail. This is an important skill because if the introduction is too long, you may bore the reader right away and lose their interest before they reach the meat of the essay. My English teacher complimented and helped me develop ways to condense my ideas. For example, in an essay I previously wrote during Twelfth grade, I started out by stating "Being a teenager is much more complex than people have it thought out to be. With the obsession over social media, you're always being monitored, watched, stalked, and most importantly judged. There is always constant pressure to impress, and perform for those around you, when, in reality, none of that matters". Do you see how that is stretched out, with numerous examples? I condensed all of that by changing it and simply saying "When in life there will always be obstacles. There will always be roadblocks in the way of achieving personal goals". I simplified the point I wanted to get across by removing all the examples and condensing my idea. I believe this is a very important tool to have because the introduction is the first thing that your reader will read. You want to make a lasting impression that will make them want to keep reading. One thing that I would like to improve on is explaining my thoughts more in depth, not in my introductions but in my body paragraphs. I keep my introductions short, but I tend to do the same thing throughout the entire piece of writing. I would like to expand on my thinking to get accustomed to writing more lengthy pieces of writing. I believe that will help me develop into a better and more fluent writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Bryan Gilman-Orozco ================================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I have found that I tend to focus most on word choice when writing academic pieces as I believe that clearly and concisely explaining my point while making presenting evidence is the key to a good writing. Whenever authors create writing that drones on with poor word choice, it immediately makes the reader disengage with the writing as well as the point the author was trying to convey in the first place. The value of using specific vernacular was instilled in me by my English teacher in eleventh grade when we were given the opportunity to practice writing college application essays. For example, in my practice college essay I originally wrote "There is quite a lot to look at with the name Bryan Gilman-Orozco, especially regarding my race" as my opening line, however my English teacher pointed out to me that by using words that could better captivate the reader's attention from the start of the writing, their attention would remain focused for a longer period of time. As such, I changed the first line to "There's a lot to unpack about the surname Gilman-Orozco, especially when it comes to what ethnicity I am". A I continue with my writing in college, I would like to focus more on creating more concise sentences. I tend to write extremely long sentences that do not qualify as run-on sentences, but still cause some readers' attention to falter. I think the best method to fix this is to create a limit for myself when I write in order to stop myself from creating extremely long and winded explanations with complicated language. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Gioffre ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write it's crucial for me to always support my claims in my writing with sufficient enough evidence as to why. In many instances of writing, you're trying to persuade the reader to be convinced in an argument you've written. If you don't argue your claims with hardly any evidence or none at all, the reader isn't going to believe the argument you're trying to make. For example, in 12^th^grade English class we were assigned to write an argumentative paper, and I did mine on why the minimum wage should be increased. The teacher when she reviewed my rough draft said despite listing a plentiful amount of reasons as to why the minimum wage should be increased, many of these reasons weren't backed up with enough evidence that proves raising the minimum wage is a good idea. She reminded to always "show, don't tell," which can apply anywhere and not just your academic studies. It reminded me to not just say I've learned something, but to utilize the skills I've learned. For me, learning how to write effectively is paramount not just so you have the ability to succeed in college studies, but also for when you move beyond college and into the real world. Being able to write at a competent enough level are skills that not only are potential future employers looking for, but also these skills can be used for simple conversation. I'll be able to communicate my thoughts and ideas much more thoroughly on paper knowing these skills, than if I have no idea how to properly use these skills. There are plenty of aspects of writing that I still need and are willing to learn, such as proper grammar, and making my writing more engaging with the audience. But going forward, I'd like to focus on learning how to use rhetorical devices more productively in my writing. Sometimes I feel like I didn't develop a strong enough argument, or I feel like my writing just missed the mark of what I was trying to convey. I believe if I successfully learn how to use these rhetorical devices such as ethos, pathos, and logos more effectively, it will help drastically improve my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Keely Glasheen ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Since middle school I have been taught that essays should be formatted by simplifying what an author says, using a large direct quote then analyzing why that quote supports the theme. The first time I learned that large chunks of the authors writing should not be dropped in the middle of my paragraphs was in my senior year of high school. This idea is relatively new to me; as such, I focus on weaving only a few words from the text into my essays. My 12th grade English teacher met with me about several of my papers and taught me that analysis becomes more eloquent if the reader can't discern between my writing and the quote I use, save for the citation. One example of shortening quotes was from my final paper in 12th grade English. I stated, "If Mary Oliver wanted a boat she couldn't steer then consider me her opposite" as opposed to stating, "Author Mary Oliver used a metaphor about how she enjoyed letting writing take her where it would. To describe this she used a metaphor about a boat in the ocean and that she would prefer to not have a sail to control the boat. I disagree with her point because I think it is important to know what you are trying to say in your essay." Using the first quote rather than the second allowed me to draw deeper analysis from Oliver's writing by connecting her ideas both with other points I was making and with the theme of the paper in a more concise way. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of writing that I would like to develop more effectively is finding a voice in my essays. In analytical papers, where pronouns are unacceptable, I find that my voice doesn't come across well and my writing is filled with generic analysis. Although my papers may fulfill requirements on a rubric, they are not interesting to read. By learning how to share my voice and articulate my thoughts more clearly in analytical papers, I will become a much stronger writer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Word Count: 343]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emma Gluchowski ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing, I like to primarily focus on keeping my writing concise and staying on track. I am able to do this by ensuring that all my writing relates back to my thesis statement and topic sentence of each body paragraph. If I notice that I am going off track and rambling, I will restart and refocus my attention back to my main idea. In high school, my english teachers helped me to work on this by making sure that all my body paragraphs related to the topic sentence of the paragraph. In twelfth grade, when we were asked to write an essay, my english teacher would encourage us to start our writing process by first writing our topic sentences and thesis statements. For example, instead of writing, "Henry James displays Pemberton as an anxious character," I would write, "Henry James displays Pemberton as an anxious character by applying to a job through the point of view." By starting my writing process with my topic sentences and thesis statements first, it allows me to focus and organize my ideas. This allows me to avert rambling and repetition, which often makes writing sound boring. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like to expand upon my writing skills by using varied syntax and more sophisticated diction. When I write, I feel that my sentence structure is often simplistic. In addition, I use a lot of long sentences. I hope to improve this so that my writing style is more developed and not as repetitive. Also, when writers add varied syntax to their work, it often adds more voice. Furthermore, I wish to expand upon my vocabulary in order to utilize more advanced diction. When writing, I feel as though my limited vocabulary often hinders my ability to create more developed and stronger sounding essays. I hope that the high vocabulary will allow my writing to mature in many ways.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Henry Goca ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a writer, I attempt to focus on as many aspects of my structure as possible. I try to keep a variety of aspects within my written work and try to pay attention to each one I am trying to illustrate. Most of these aspects are subconsciously included in my writing after repeated use of them over the years. One most recent aspect of my writing that I include in my writing is organizing my work into coherent paragraphs. I was introduced to this concept in high school, by my eleventh grade English teacher. In this class she taught us how to convey our thoughts in each of our writings. This helped us include details we needed within standardized essay responses. To get us to write this way, my teacher developed a "RACE" format that we would incorporate in each body paragraph of an essay that was usually about researching or analyzing. This acronym meant that we were to start off by restating the claims we created in the introduction. This is followed by answering the question at hand, which would usually be agreeing with or disagreeing with a thesis. Then, with the use of citations, give evidence to support our claims and end with an explanation of how the evidence ties into our ideas and claims. An example of putting this to use was while writing a paper on how people are successful leaders. I restated my claim, "Hitler, although inhumane was a successful leader. I then answered the thesis that leaders, like Hitler are successful in certain ways. I then provided textual evidence to support my claim and tied it into my thesis. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [There is still a lot I need to learn in my writing. I know that not every writing will fit within this writing style and I still must learn other ways of structuring my writing pieces. I would look to develop such traits here at Geneseo. The skill of creating a well structured style is an important aspect of writing because it allows for a smooth flow of information. It begins with my thoughts, in which I need to sort in a logical sequence to ensure I've included exactly what I want in my writing. It then ends with the audience of the writing, where they are able to efficiently comprehend my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Breeonna Godkin ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Breeonna Godkin ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [09/11/19 ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my essays I like to focus on the explanation of my evidence and how it connects to my claim or topic. Being able to explain my evidence helps show and support my claim and make it into a stronger and more impactful essay. Over this summer, I participated in the AOP, Access Opportunity Program, where I had taken INTD 170. In INTD 170, I wrote an essay about homelessness impacting America. In my essay I provided many quotes, details and explanations about my topic and claim. In my essay I included, "Also countless "Home individuals have higher rates of visual impairment than the general population and are at greater risk for not obtaining appropriate glycemic control when diabetic" (Tsai, 2017, p.3). These illnesses and diseases, if untreated can risk one's life, such as death and having the condition for the rest of their life. With these conditions, it can cause many infections and add other medical problems onto the other one. Homeless people live a risky and dangerous while living on the streets with conditions and illnesses that are life treating.

She would give me tips on making the explanation connect back to my claim and quote. She was a great help to my work and she's allowed me to grow and improve my writing as a student in college. I believe these skills are important for writing because it helps build and make your essay stronger. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my future writings, I'd like to focus and approve my grammar and the ability to start and write an introduction paragraph.

When writing I tend to create a writing plan where I write the main points that I am going to develop. Doing this allows me to see that every aspect is covered and well supported. I have gotten feedback on how to organize my ideas in advance by my English teacher the last two years of high school. She taught me to work with a template where I only write the thesis statement that must go in the introduction, then the topic sentences of each paragraph in a few words with the supportive ideas of each one. Finally, I would have to write the conclusion that restate the thesis. One example could be an essay I wrote during my last year of high school where I initially had so many ideas and thoughts that only through planning I organized and lately developed my essay. I filled the template initially with my thesis statement that was "]{data-contrast="auto"}[The life of American students ]{data-contrast="none"}[are]{data-contrast="none"}[ affected by gender bias at schools and colleges." Afterward, I selected two topic sentences for my paragraphs that were "Dress codes are targeted at girls." and "Gender gap in undergraduate majors."

I started using this technique my junior year of high school when a teacher looked over one of my essays and pointed out that I was using the same words too many times, and also that in some cases I could choose better words to give my piece a more professional sound. I'm thankful she brought this to my attention because it made me realize how important it is to have good vocabulary use, poor vocabulary choice in my essays was leading to my writing sounding repetitive and immature. One example of this revision process is starting with a simple phrase such as "his grandmother, a simple lady who taught him a lot of things like which plants he could use for medicine, and made him curious with travel tales of her dead sailor-husband", then replacing some words transforming it into something sounding more mature and interesting; "his grandmother, a simple lady who taught him a variety of skills including knowledge over herbal medications, and sparked his curiosity with travel tales of her deceased sailor-husband".]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I'd like to improve the general flow and structure of my writing.

The problem is that once I go back to review my writing, I realize that I've deviated from my thesis either using repeated themes, sentences or simple filler. My AP Literature helped me get past this struggle in my writing. My teacher had given me useful templates in order to better structure my essay. I do better with templates on how to do an essay because I often need that guidance or recommended way in structuring. With a template I don't end up overthinking and being stuck on a paragraph for hours. When I was writing an essay in May I struggled for a while. It took me a full week of getting my friend to read it and give me advice to finally finish my essay. While reviewing and rewriting my essay I realized that I often focused more on the word count than on the quality of what I had written. The book was *Memoirs of a Geisha* by Arthur Golden and the instructions for the essay were vague. After my rough draft and having my friend read it, I realized how much filler I had or repeated sentences and themes I had included. I went back to my template and using it along with the advice of my friends I was able to rewrite the essay till I satisfied. Having a lot of filler also deviated my essay from the main thesis I had created. My biggest issue was how to do citations when doing an assignment about the author\'s life. I had incorrectly done the citations and it wasn't until a friend saw it that I realized. Going back the template I corrected my mistake, but I still struggle with it. Going forward, I'd like to concentrate on citing my sources correctly and not adding unnecessary filler. With citing I rely too much on statements or quotes without ever using my own words. It feels more like a ton of quotes without any of my own voice flowing through. I feel nervous that everyone here is a better writer than me and I'll fall behind, but how can I become a better writer if I don't try or practice.

Organization is crucial to the flow of the essay, if the essay has horrendous organization it is agonizing to read and can sometimes feel like a chore to decipher the meaning. I first realized this weakness in 11th grade when my English teacher stated countless times that my essays were similar to solving a word search. My English teacher would always highlight sentences to convey sentences that should have been pieced together and truly made me aware of the mistake I made. After re-reading old essays it became evident that I had a severe case of rambling without any structure, especially in argument essays. For example, if I wrote a paper about self driving cars I would state a point about how self driving cars prevent accidents, then proceed to another point without elaborating on how these cars stop unnecessary accidents. If you kept reading these old papers at some point toward the end of the paragraph is when I would finally elaborate on how these cars prevent accidents and it would feel out of place to the reader. Ever since then I have begun to work on organizing my papers whether it is through revising them over and over, or creating a web to lay out the structure I make sure that it is not a burden to read.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future I would like to learn how to condense my papers more.

I find that word choice makes a big difference in how effectively an intended message is conveyed. This is always something that can be improved. More generally, I feel that focusing on content in the draft and then revising the presentation of this information is an efficient method to ensure all points are not only present but are easily understood by the reader. Examining and changing vocabulary choices is particularly helpful because the varying meanings and connotations associated with seemingly similar words can strongly affect the reader\'s perception of the content. By changing a term ever so slightly, a writer is able to shift the mood of a phrase, sentence, or work as a whole. This is incredibly important in communicating through writing. Although many teachers have suggested switching specific words over the years, I have truly come to realize the importance of it as a reader. I\'ve found that the level of engagement and understanding I gain from a text is extremely dependent on how effectively the author uses words to communicate the information. I may struggle to fully grasp content from certain sources due to poor word choice, meanwhile, another author explaining similar content is able to create writing that resonates and sticks with me. I've realized I can achieve the same effect through my own writing. An example of me using particular vocab to emphasize my point can be found in an argumentative essay I wrote during my junior year of high school, including the statement "A universal health care system has the potential to help the most vulnerable Americans". I used the phrase "the most vulnerable Americans" rather than, for example "high-risk citizens" because I felt this helped the reader sympathize with the group described. The term vulnerability is an a sense associated with being human. The use of this term hopefully better conveyed the fact that we are in many cases referring to ordinary people, perhaps with much in common with the reader. Going forward, I\'d like to focus more on sentence structure. I feel that this is also a very important component of making sure one\'s work is perceived as desired. While I am fairly confident in my vocabulary, I recognize that sentence structure isn't something I've focused as heavily on in the past. I understand that this can make writing confusing or unclear.]{style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christopher Gosley ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Christopher Gosley\ Self Reflection\ Throughout high school, I dealt with a plethora of different writing "struggles" such as difficulty in articulating what exactly I am talking about in an essay. Getting to the point has been very hard for me to do in past years. Getting to the actual point in an essay is very important because whether or not a person is reading your essay there needs to be a clear cut point to why you are writing it. So during sophomore and junior year, I would go to writing workshops to fix the problems with my writing skills. Thanks to the help of my amazing English teachers I was able to get over the problem that I had which was not getting to the point in my essay. This is my intro to one of my essays "The director of the movie Forrest Gump has many ideas but the main one is that throughout American history we have ups and downs but at the end, we are striving to be a greater nation.". Instead of me saying there are many ideas and I just talk about the one then there isn\'t any confusion to the reader that there is only one idea that I am going to talk about. I think I am very attentive to the skills that I have right now; I\'m still developing as a writer but as far as my learning skills I\'m more of a visual learner I need to see something done before I can do it. I feel as though I can develop my grammar and functional skills way better and I hope will throughout the year.

I actually realized this myself, I started to realize that my paper was always full of information but the fluidity was never what I wanted it to be. I believe that my papers generally have all the information it needs but the fluidity of the paper can be a lot better. Before every essay I write I gather up everything I need and I feel that I\'m ready to go. I also constantly revise which throws me off of the flow that I\'m looking for, which I believe is a problem. An example of my fluidity problem comes off of an essay I had to write in a course I took in high school, the course was a called sports literature. I was writing about how I believe LeBron James is the best basketball player ever. In the essay I wrote \"People always argue with me telling me that Michael Jordan was better then LeBron James but I always point out facts like, LeBron made it to six finals appearances in a row and won three in that span. He also has the most well rounded stats, and is not only compared to finesse players like Michael Jordan, but he\'s also compared to dominant players like Shaquille O\'neal.\" Maybe I\'m crazy but I feel like I could\'ve made this flow better rather then just stating facts. Something I want to improve on in my writing ability is my grammar and vocabulary. I feel like my grammar is a little better then my vocabulary but there are some instances where I tragically mess up with grammar. Not only does my vocabulary make my writing a little weaker but it also confuses me when I read. Going forward, I plan on looking up the meaning of words when I don\'t quite understand what they mean. I think this will help me dramatically.

Support and affirmation can make or break an argument. The reader can either be swayed for or against your thesis depending on the strength, use and authentication of the evidence in the piece. Before I determine weather, my evidence is going to be incorporated into my essay I make sure of two important factors to a good piece of evidence; the authentication and the effectiveness of the quote. I make sure that the source that I got my evidence from is a good reliable source. In my essays I only use those that come from a source I and my audience can trust, such as articles from a database a journal from a respected figure, primary sources and an educated site. Once I've found a quote, I make sure to properly introduce it. For example, I would say: Tomkins compares this feeling to "the idea of ghost limbs. You know, when you've lost a leg, or an arm and you still feel it's still there" (Tomkins Loc 638). With that introduction I properly included the author and what he was trying to express. After the quote I explain how it is useful to my argument by connecting it to my thesis by describing the quote and the word choice within it. For example, here I would say how the buildings were of great importance to the New Yorkers that they feel as though they lost a part of them. My high school teachers placed major emphasis on evidence which is why it is so important to me. One of my biggest challenges I have when writing is planning. I can plan the essay and structure well but what I have trouble with is planning the length of my writing. It\'s like when you write on a poster and you think you have so much room and you start off big ...but then you see the amount of space left and have to cram the. I could possibly better this by writing or extensive drafts and outlines to get a feel for the length of writing. Planning my word count it the aspect that I would like to work on the most.

My thesis will not be strong or valid if I do not have multiple examples of concrete examples that support it. My teachers throughout high school taught me the importance of providing strong evidence to support my thesis. They taught me how to identify pieces of evidence that were strong and how to use them in my writing to support my thesis. In a recent paragraph I wrote about a short story involving a robot named QT, I had to discuss whether the robot was rational or not. I provided many solid examples of why the robot was not rational because he denies the existence of the universe, humans and the fact that robots were created by humans. For example, I say "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[When Powell and Donovan build a robot in front of QT, he says the parts we created by the master and they merely put them together.When the two men ask QT about books that clearly prove the universe, humanity and the human creation of robots, he says The Master wrote them to give humans an explanation on their existence." Those are just a few examples of the evidence I used to show the robot was not rational.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I believe there are more skills I could learn to improve my writing. One aspect of writing I could improve on is making my sentences flow better in my writing. I often write redundant and repetitive sentences that start the same. My writing becomes kind of a list. I want to learn how to transition between my sentences better so they are not repetitive and have good flow.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sophia Grazioso ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Sophia Grazioso\ INTD 106\ 3 September 2019\ In my writing, I focus on creating a strong thesis that is represented throughout the entire piece of writing that I am working on. A strong, clear and precise thesis is crucial for any essay. Creating a strong and clear thesis is so important because it sums up the entirety of the essay right from the beginning. Your thesis statement should be clarified in the introductory paragraph of your essay. Once it is stated, you must stick to the same thesis and continue to relate each piece of your writing back to the original thesis. If your thesis is unclear, the reader won't understand the point or reasoning of the essay. I once had to write a research essay on a topic of my choice. I chose the topic of social media and mental health in teenagers. I was very confident in my essay but soon realized I was running out of items to write about. So I started branching off of my thesis and making a new one out od the same one. My professor explained to me that this was not a good strategy and had to be fixed. If it wasn't fixed, it would just confuse the readers and be unclear. For example, if your thesis of a research paper is, "Social media may be a great way to connect with other people over the internet, but it also takes effect on the mental state of a teenager", you cant change that statement later on and say "watching TV effects the mental state of a teenager". You may be able to connect watching TV to your thesis by showing in detail how it connects to social media, maybe being influenced by it, but you cannot alter your thesis. Altering your thesis throughout your essay creates confusion and makes a sloppy essay.\ Continuing on with my writing, I plan to focus more on vocabulary. I feel that I have not explored a wide enough range of vocabulary and therefore cannot continue to make my writings more complex. Increasing complexity of my writing through vocabulary would be very helpful in my future writing assignments. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jennifer Greek ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jennifer Greek]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [September 8, 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Your Writing Priorities ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When writing academically I have to keep aware of run on sentences. I've noticed that I tend to write the way that I speak which leads to a lot of revising. I have a hard time being straight to the point, and concise. So while writing academically I pay extra attention to the focus of my writing to stray away from going off on unnecessary tangents. I am someone who can talk a mile a minute and I often write as an outlet, so it is imperative that I pay close attention to it while writing for a grade. This is super important because without staying focused on the point it is often easy to confuse, and bore the reader. The advice given to me by teachers in the past was to just keep writing whatever thought came into my mind to make sure I put all thoughts out there before going back and cleaning it up. They taught me that having a lot of opinion and thought is not necessarily a bad thing. In a past essay of mine on ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Twelfth Night ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[by Shakespeare, I originally wrote, "Malvolio lets his ego run free when he insults Feste, and that causes tension with Olivia but soon after Olivia sticks up for the clown." After writing my thoughts down in a very scrambled way I went back to make it more concise and less vague. In the official and graded essay on the play I wrote, "Malvolio lets his self righteousness show while insulting Feste which leaves him uneasy with Olivia. After Malvolio tears down the clown Olivia strikes back." Rewriting it this way made it a lot easier to follow because it flows better. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Something I definitely want to get better at for future writing is grammar. I often feel like I put punctuation in spots because the pauses and exclamations portray how I speak. Although that can be dangerous for me due to my sarcastic nature. I feel like this improvement goes hand in hand with the run on sentences that I have been working hard to fix. If I had a better understanding of grammar, I think that it would help advance my writing skills for the future. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katie Greek ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I have a bad habit of scattering my thoughts and writing too much. I tend to put information that belongs in one paragraph in other ones and jump from different topics a lot so it's all scattered. This is a habit I try and not do because organization in writing is very important and helps make it easier to get your point across to the reader. In the past when my teacher's have read what I wrote, that seemed to be a regular comment that they made. Last year I wrote a narrative about the importance of honesty. My thesis statement was, "honesty is important and necessary because it makes for healthy relationships and besides that, lying makes situations worse and the truth always finds a way of coming out." My second body paragraph wasn't scattered and all the points I made were necessary and relevant to the point I was trying to get across, but my first and third body paragraph got a little mixed up. I had made a point in the first paragraph that "in middle school, my sister and I used to catch our friends lying to us by hanging out behind our backs." In my third paragraph I made the same exact point instead of using a different piece of evidence. This made my writing a little scattered because I made that point at the beginning and brought back the same point in a different paragraph. My teacher pointed that out and we talked for a little bit about my habit of scattering my writing. To help me, she went through the narrative with me and pointed out when something was out of place. That was very helpful and I kept that in mind with my other pieces of writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [A new skill that I want to develop in Geneseo is to get better at descriptive writing. There are times where I feel that I am not thorough enough when I'm describing something which can make things unclear sometimes for the person reading. When people read something they want to be able to paint a picture in their heads about what they're reading about. I know for me personally, I prefer to read things that allow me to be creative in my own mind, I want to allow people to be able to do that through something that I wrote.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ (400 words) ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Allen Gregg ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I mainly try to develop my introduction as it is mainly important for the reader to know what they\'re about to read. Focusing on introductions allows me to practice many other different elements such as hooks, how lengthy a sentence, which helps me think and ask myself "does it flow with the theme of the paper?" For example, I wrote a research paper that say "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[What if someone told you that within a century most of the East Coast will be completely submerged. This great catastrophe is happening due to global warming from air pollution from a variety of sources such as power plants, vehicles, and industrial sites. Deforestation as well increases the severity and quickens the process of climate change, then as global temperatures start to increase the polar ice caps begin to melt. This then leads to ocean levels rising and overall flooding that can damage and destroy homes and habitats of the fauna as well as mass migration. Flooding also disrupts fishing and tourism within cities that live on the coast. As cities that depend on fishing and tourism as their main recourse will lose them. If trends continue as is then soon rather than later most of the East Coast will be completely submerged underwater."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[. Before editing the intro was poor as it didn\'t explain what the paper was about, reading it was boring as it wasn\'t interesting and the sentences were dragging on instead of to the point. After editing the paper it started with a better hook to interest the reader to invest their time into reading my paper and made sure to give a general consensus into what my paper is about and lastly shortened the sentences so they wouldn\'t drag on and were to the point. This is one of the examples of how I mainly practice as I\'m not really great at writing intros for papers and sometimes it\'s hard for me to put down what I\'m thinking on paper, but usually, if its a topic that I\'m very knowledgeable in I usually have no problem starting it. A few areas that still need development is just grammar and punctuation, as I\'m very confused in some parts of it. Managing time is another I need to work on as well as it\'s hard for me to divide my work into pieces rather than to just finish it in one sitting. How I combat all the problems is through friends and teachers constantly proofreading my work as it helps me improve my overall writing and wording. Although I\'m not very great at proofreading myself, that\'s just another area within my writing that I need to improve myself in. From this class, I hope to improve all my writing skills and become a better writer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Drew Grennan ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Drew Grennan Personal Writing Reflection In my writing academically up to this point, I'd say that my work on properly and concisely concluding my writing is what I need to work the most on. My writing tends to not include a very good conclusion, which I would say lies with my inability to concisely package all of my thoughts together into one firm conclusion at the end as opposed to a long and drawn out conclusion, which is not what a conclusion is supposed to look like. When I am writing any kind of writing, such as the research paper I did a few years ago in high school or even some of the more opinionated pieces I did last year, I seem to say more in the actual paper than I really need too, which probably contributes to my difficulty in providing a "short and sweet" conclusion. In writing a solid conclusion, you provide a clear platform for the reader to develop their own thoughts about the topic being presented as well as reiterate the thesis of the writing and really just wrap it up in a way that is helpful to the reader in understanding what you had been writing about the whole time. The conclusions that I had been writing previously would last for almost half a page when maybe a much shorter paragraph would've done the job much better. I would likely attribute that to trying to make a word count threshold or because I was rambling about a topic I wasn't particularly interested in and didn't have much to say in the body paragraphs of the piece of writing. This skill, and most skills in general, I feel is important due to the fact that I've had papers that could've gotten much higher grades than they actually did just because the conclusion was poor. I feel as though this skill is a very important one for me to learn, which I hope this class and the in-class section of this class will help me improve upon. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jenay Griffin =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The main point I focus on while I'm writing is organization. It is important that my thoughts and ideas come together logically when I am writing if I want to be successful. Organization allows me to better get my point across and keep things flowing and easier to understand. When I was writing a paper on why the character I picked would survive a zombie apocalypse in English class, I had a lot of points that I wanted to touch on, but was having difficulty tying them together. My English teacher agreed that the essay wasn't flowing well, and together we found ways to combine ideas from different paragraphs and eliminate the fluff that wasn't adding to the story. For example, I wrote about his characteristics in one paragraph, his strengths in another, and additional information explaining the assignment and what his friends thought of him in another. It just wasn't flowing well. As a result, I put his characteristics and strengths in the same paragraph, moved the information explaining the assignment to the beginning, and removed the information about what his friends thought of him because it wasn't crucial to the story. By making those changes, the essay was more structured, concise, and easier to follow. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Organization helps me to look at my work more critically and pay more attention to the structure. Before, when I would write, my ideas would be all over the place and didn't make sense. But, that doesn't happen as often anymore since I was taught how to think from the perspective of the reader and not just myself. When my ideas are organized properly, I feel like my writing is more purposeful. However, my essays still aren't perfectly structured, and sometimes I think of ideas as I'm revising and try to fit them into the essay, but it doesn't always make sense or add to the value of the paper. I then have to decide if the information is really crucial for the essay or not. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would like to concentrate more on formality. I tend to write like I'm talking to a friend. I think that increasing my vocabulary would help me improve this skill. Currently, when I write, I don't use a variety of complex words. I believe that as my vocabulary improves, I will gain confidence to use more challenging words that will help me become a better academic writer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Thomas Griffin ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} An aspect of academic writing that I actively focus on is utilizing higher level vocabulary appropriate for the collegiate level. This makes my writing more captivating and allows for greater depth and accuracy in communicating my ideas. When nothing but simple vocabulary is used in writing, the piece seems rushed, unthoughtful, and shallow. I became more aware of and focused on the vocabulary I implement through the words I learned and advice I received from my twelfth grade AP English teacher. In her course, I learned how to improve upon the basic ideas and points I wish to convey by writing out the sentence I initially have in my head, such as "In *The Great Gatsby*, one of the main themes is that rich people hurt others by not caring", and then revise it by swapping out vague, low level vocabulary for more accurate and advanced terms we had previously discussed in class. The revised statement would then ensure my sentence illustrates the level of complexity expected of collegiate writing and read "In *The Great Gatsby*, one of the quintessential themes present throughout the book is that the wealthy hurt those around them through their recklessness." An area of academic writing that I could personally use improvement in is ensuring that I incorporate enough of the work I am discussing into my writing. While I am always eager to become more proficient in writing skills I have yet to utilize well, I have found incorporating this specific skill into my writing to be a significant challenge. I often use only a few excerpts or ideas from the work I am discussing and over analyze them, limiting my ability to address holistic concepts and making my writing possess less substance. A possible method of improving upon this skill is selecting several excerpts from the work before I begin writing and forming my discussion around them, instead of fitting excerpts around my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ava Grill-Dubois ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Ava Grill-DuBois Self-Reflection \#1 9/5/19 I try to focus on keeping my writing concise because I tend to be extremely wordy in my work. I repeat myself and use unnecessary words. Writing needs to be concise and to the point, because it makes it sound professional. I learned a lot about being concise during my Junior and Senior years of high school while taking Language and Literature. My teachers taught me how to combine sentences and get rid of words that were unnecessary or repetitive. One example of how I changed a piece of work was in the opening statement of a paragraph of an essay. I began with, "When we look closely at the symptoms that Edmund experienced throughout King Lear, it becomes clear that he had Antisocial Personality Disorder from the start of the play. He may have even had it during his childhood." I met with some peers and my teacher and I realized that there was a better way to phrase this. So my final paper looked like, "Given the symptomology of Edmund in King Lear, he probably had Antisocial Personality Disorder from the start of the play, maybe even during his childhood." I realized that I use a lot of unneeded words and sentences to try and make myself sound smarter when the actual smarter thing is to be concise. It makes it a lot easier for the reader to understand what your argument is if you are concise and unrepetitive. In this case, I took a group of words---"at the symptoms that"---and changed it to one word---"symptomology". I also changed, "When we look closely" to, "Given". It additionally suggested that I combine some of my sentences, so I did so with these two sentences, instead combining them with a comma. \ I hope, in the future, to focus more on the formality of my work. I can be very informal in my writing and tend to write as if I were speaking. I have trouble converting the words in my head into a school paper. I want to learn how to take my conversational work and turn it into a well-written piece that an academic would write. I hope this class can help me in achieving that. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Molley Gross ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus most on the structure of my thesis while ensuring it is concise and clear. I use it as a roadmap for my entire paper as my twelfth grade English teacher taught me. This helps me keep track of the direction of my paper as I have a tendency to diverge from my main points. For example, here is a thesis I used for my Western Drama class: "This play convincingly takes the form of realism, in the idea that it depicts a scenario that accurately represents reality through its form, dialogue, and setting. However, its outcome can be viewed in two entirely different lights, a call for feminist action or a mother deserting her family at Christmastime. As the audience brings their own lens to a production, the meaning then cannot be fixed by form and is entirely dependent on the composition and perception of the audience." Here, I lay out what I will be focusing on (the form, dialogue, and setting) and then continue to address those topics in that order. After writing my paper, I will go back and make sure I addressed every aspect of my thesis. Sometimes my paper changes direction or I form a different opinion on the topic as I go along. My ENGL 203 teacher taught me that it is okay to then go back and change elements of my thesis to fit the direction my paper ended up taking. For example I ended up submitting a paper with this thesis instead of my original: "The novel's position on this conflict is shown primarily through Sol's speech where it seems to take his position on asking Europeans to change their views on Americans. Overall, the text challenges the European's way of life and development, suggesting that it is not superior. In doing so, however, the text begins to take the same approach as the European's supposedly do as it examines so many negative aspects of European lifestyle that it starts to imply American lifestyle is superior." Originally, I did not realize or examine the implication of American lifestyle being superior in regards to the text.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I would like to work on being more concise in my writing. I recognize that I tend to go over the required page length which is not always a good thing. A possible solution to this is limiting what I decide to cite. I often pull a lot of quotes that I think perfectly summarize my points, but I also pull much more than I need to. Instead, I need to work on putting things into my own words instead of using lengthy quotes. This should help keep me within the suggested page limit.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mya Gruin ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Mya Gruin One aspect of academic writing that I focus on mainly is getting the purpose of my paper across clearly. When writing my college essay, I tried to focus on the main reason on why I chose to write about the topic that I did. My intentions were to entertain, inform, and explain as direct as I could when discussing. This writing skill is important to me because I want to focus on the main idea and not get sidetracked and add in unnecessary details within my story that take away from the main purpose. I want to get my point across within my writing and successfully have someone fully invested in my piece without distractions. My college essay was about an old friend of mine who had almost destroyed my reputation and aspects of my life. The purpose of the essay was to show my growth through my toxic friendship with her and how I managed to get through it and become stronger. My intention was to not make it all about her and just focus on all the horrible things she did to me, it was a progression story of me and my improvement as a person. My mother who is an English teacher at my old high school and her co worker Mr. B helped me when editing my paper and gave me extremely helpful feedback. They informed me that I had made the story all about the girl and barely myself, so with that being said I had a lot of editing to do. I made the first paragraph about some of the things she did with social media, my other friends, my family, and boys, but the other three paragraghs were about me. I wrote about overcoming bullying and threats and the help I received and how it shaped me into the person I am today. The essay made me a better writer from then on out because I primarily focus on the main purpose and I've become a more advanced writer ever since. I now inform within my papers and instead of rambling about insignificant details. One aspect of writing I want to become more efficient in is sentence and paragraph structure. Within my writing I tend to use a lot of run-ons and mash sentences together that don't even have the same topic. With paragraphs I write too much and then two different subjects are in the same paragraph and it gets confusing for the people reading it. I need to learn how to space things out more and not try and squeeze everything on one page or into one sentence. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Teresa Gutierrez ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Currently I focus the most on elaborating on the quotes that I use in papers.

My two US History teachers junior year helped me when it came to DBQ essays and backing my points up but I do not have copies of my drafts or essays. In twelfth grade my AP government teacher also gave me great feedback on a Supreme Court paper that I wrote which I was later able to use in my senior thesis.

There are millions and millions of writings, how does a writer make their work stand out? After many years of writing, I realized that no matter what I was writing, whether it was an analysis paper or research paper, I always tend to have a very poetic tone of voice. Having found my voice, has made my papers all the more interesting. Using a poetic tone, I learned that you can make the most boring or sorrowful topics very intriguing. Last year, I had to write an essay about depression. In my essay I concluded that "When we are left alone with our monsters due to the wrongful actions of others we can only hope that the ones who care for us will shine so bright that our demons will be blinded." I feel as though this quote really exemplifies the poetic nature of my work. Instead of using words such as 'depression' or 'mental illness', I decided to compare it to 'monsters' and 'demons' to symbolize the darkness that resonates in people who are struggling. I first learned of my skill back in the 11th grade. I had written a paper on]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ and during that time my teacher focused heavily on us finding our own voice.

I constantly stop to fix my spelling, as well as being wary of pronoun disagreements and comma splices. Lately, during my free time I try to go online and do small exercises to improve my grammar.

However, one of my weaknesses includes my tendency to ramble on about a certain topic. Sometimes, this creates an issue with how concise my sentences are or it will form run on sentences. Being concise is important to both create a convincing argument and defend a point in a way that maintains an appropriate tone of the piece. I believe it is one of the most important aspects of maintaining a solid demeanor through the piece. Often I have received feedback from peers and teachers on this aspect of my writing, saying that it makes my writing weaker. By making my sentences more concise and by using different punctuation that tie ideas together, my writing can become stronger as a whole. This would cause my argument to be more convincing and thoughtful. One example of this is represented in one of the projects I had to do for a course in high school. This writing assignment was part of my IB English course and was a piece on the books we have read.

I still make similar mistakes in my writing, but reviewing a writing assignment myself, days after writing it, has always helped.

I hope to improve on conciseness, while also being able to keep my analyses as descriptive as possible. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Wren Guzman ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} An aspect of academic writing I focus on when writing drafts is concision. I believe that you don't need a multitude of words to get a point across. I remember mindlessly typing out more words than necessary just to suit a word count. My AP English Language and Composition teacher was amazing at providing feedback regarding concision. She would ask me to reread what I wrote out loud in order to catch any repetition of a claim. Another piece of advice she offered was to paraphrase what I already wrote, and continually do so until the sentences were condensed and made sense. An example of this was when I wrote an argumentative essay on whether or not the school week should be shortened. Using my teachers' advice, this is a portion of the essay that I edited and used the strategy of concision; everything highlighted in blue was crossed out.:\ "Sure, there might be some families that are able to care for their child on that day with no school, but there are many that are not able to. I believe that the school week should not be shortened to four days, with each[ week]{style="background-color: #00ccff;"} day being longer because it takes students a [certain]{style="background-color: #00ccff;"} longer amount of time to get home [meaning that they will most likely have less homework time and less time for leisure activities]{style="background-color: #00ccff;"} and children might forget what they learned on a certain day. [Another reason why I believe school weeks shouldn't be shortened is, the fact that some families might not be able to care for the child on the day that there might not be school, as well as financially be able to hire a care-taker for the child. ]{style="background-color: #00ccff;"}Families might also not be financially stable to provide care for their children.\" An aspect I wish to develop effectively, for writing at Geneseo, would be my grammar. English is not my first language and I am learning more and more everyday how to produce grammatically correct work. I look forward to continuing to develop this aspect at Geneseo with the help of my professors. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Haber ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Emily Haber INTD 106 -- Self Reflection Professor Paku 2 September 2019 Throughout my writing, I usually focus a substantial amount on formatting my introduction paragraph in a way that provides a well-developed thesis statement. This will allow my audience to be prepared for what I will elaborate on in my following body paragraphs. If an introduction paragraph appears extremely vague and doesn't provide much insight as to what I will be talking about, it is very hard for the reader to grasp what the main idea of the writing is going to be about. Some thesis statements may come across as boring. My 11^th^grade English teacher helped me realize this as we were writing an essay about an Apple IPad Air commercial. I went from creating a very broad sentence, to thinking of a way to put together a powerful thought that would allow my audience to understand what specific points I would be hitting as they continued to read my essay. My teacher felt it was very important to have a clear sentence that would provide understanding and would highlight what would be coming in my body paragraphs. Before 11^th^grade, I was completely satisfied with writing "The Apple IPad Air commercial showed many different techniques to allow the audience to understand the tone." After realizing how essential these thesis statements are, with the help of my teacher, I was able to come up with a sentence a lot more intricate. The revised sentence enhanced my readers' ability to comprehend what I was going to talk about in my further body paragraphs. For example, I changed that extremely unclear statement to the sentence, "The language and diction that was shown using outside texts helped to develop the intense/powerful tone of the advertisement." Now, I feel very confident that I can write a well-thought thesis statement that will set up my essay in a way that will be very clear as to what the main idea of my writing will be. In my future writings, I hope to focus more on using a wider range of vocabulary. I have the tendency to get redundant with my word choice and I feel that if I could expand my vocabulary, it would make my writings a lot more effective. Furthermore, I believe having a larger vocabulary could not only help me with my own writing, but also help me understand more advanced readings.

When I write, I try my best to make it sound like it is me speaking, I try to write the same words of which I would speak. I try and do this using a combination of word my choice and also punctuation. Throughout high school, I was enrolled in honors and AP English classes that I believe have really helped me to become a better writer. Here is a quote from an essay that I wrote for my \'Writing at the Threshold\' class in my senior year of high school. \"[Since I was an infant, my family and I have spent the summer onboard the Necessity, dropping anchor anywhere from Lake Montauk to Nantucket, sleeping on the boat, waking up in the morning, taking the dinghy to shore and spending the day running around whatever port or island we were at. My most defining memories from my childhood are from leaving the parents on the boat and going to explore all of the forests and beaches that I could get to on my own.\"]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [You can see immediately what I mean when I say that I use punctuation heavily in my writing to give it a more vocal tone. The commas in this segment make it much easier to read than if I were to chop it up into more, shorter sentences. I sorted out the commas chronologically so it would make more sense for the reader. This section was from the intro of my essay where I went on to tell a story about the time when me and my two closest friends took out my sailboat, alone, for 2 weeks of pure fun and relaxation. The intro here gives a background to the significance of sailing throughout my life so when you read the rest of the essay you can understand the magnitude of the effect that this trip had on me.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like to concentrate more on staying on topic. I find myself very often going too in depth into narratives, which in the end, can hurt the original purpose of the essay, whatever it might be. Even though I try consciously to stay on track, I feel that my writing is damaged or weakened when I don\'t fully describe a situation even if it has nothing to do with the task at hand.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kyle Hafter ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write, I focus primarily on staying on task. More often than not, I get sidetracked and start writing about irrelevant information. Staying on task and focusing on the topic makes sure the reader understands what I'm trying to say and not get confused. As I reread my drafts, I pinpoint relevant data and sentences and alter or sometimes delete the sentences that have no point in being in my essays. An example of this was in the tenth when I was writing a paper about Kudzu, an invasive plant that has many destructing qualities toward the environment. As I was writing it, I realized I started to write about how the leaves are edible and how many people would sometimes eat it, which was completely not important to the essay. When I gave it to one of my tutors, she took a red pen and crossed out most of my paper. It really took a toll on me and helped me develop a keen eye when I write. I'm grateful she was so harsh on me because I always check for unnecessary information in everything that I write.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} As I continue through college, I would like to concentrate on using sources the correct way and incorporating quotes to further prove my point of discussion.

I am eager to begin learning and moving toward what\'s expected of me at an advanced academic writing level. In high school my teachers and I would sit down often, trying to improve my skills. The most common, and best advice I received was to be more descriptive and add more depth to my writing. Writing descriptively is important for the main purpose of writing, which is to speak to the audience in a way in which they understand, process, and can respond. In a persuasive paper on Universal Healthcare, I use little description which makes my argument appear weak and uneducated. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[" ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The main argument against Universal healthcare is that it would cost our government an incredible amount, that would ultimately be taken from citizens income and payroll taxes.

Michael Pollan even wrote a book about the interactions psychedelics have in our brain, and in our culture called "How to Change your Mind". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* [One skill I would like to develop is transition. I would like my writing to resemble conversation in the sense of flow not dialogue. This skill would also help the audience connect to my writing and process it easier. With smoother flow and transition, my writing would improve drastically and is in my eyes the most dire skill that needs development and improvement in my writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Victoria Hamilton =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of my writing style that I try to be conscious of is making a claim or statement and further elaborating on it. Sometimes, I will write something in an essay, and not go back and define it or explain why I wrote it in the first place. I have, however, become more conscious of this since I first started college, two years ago, and I have received feedback on how to correct it. My professors and English teachers have taught me to always elaborate on my claims and try to make my papers engaging without being boring. In AP English, which I took during my senior year of high school, we read and analyzed several forms of literature, including [They Say/I Say]{.underline}, which taught us to make our papers interesting enough so that our audience would understand our statements. We also wrote several argumentative pieces that year, which taught us how to acknowledge different types of perspectives and how to elaborate on them. When I write an essay, I like to be descriptive without making the paper too verbose or even dull. And when describing something, I usually allot a sentence or two right after I make a statement and then I will go back to it later on. I like to use language such as "moreover", "for example", and "this is when..." to define what I am talking about. An excerpt from a paper that I wrote portrays this: "The self-fulfilling prophecy is the idea that we often make our stereotypes come true. For example, John might have a negative expectation towards Sara, and because of this, he may act rude towards her, which in turn might cause her to act rude towards him. This would confirm his expectation about her." I try to make my claims concise, but also open to interpretation, and I always like to go back and revise my papers so that my reader knows what I'm trying to say. One improvement I would like to make regarding my writing is the ability to write a research paper without relying too heavily on the use of quotes. Sometimes, I focus too much on what the authors of another source are saying instead of the point I'm trying to make. And I do have a knack for seamlessly including quotes in my papers, but I often feel like I do it too much. Another improvement I'd like to make is keeping my claim or claims strong and apparent throughout my paper. I can sometimes digress from my original claim if the paper I am writing is long. I'd like to learn how to write a solid paper without losing my reader and keeping my points consistent throughout the piece. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ethan Hanse ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Ethan Hanse 9/4/19 Throughout my years of writing experience, I have learned many things, including new skills, better vocabulary, and more subjects to write about. For example, prior to my AP Literature class in my senior year of high school, I never actually learned how to use quotes in my essays. I would just copy and paste multiple sentences of what I thought was related to what I was saying, cite that source at the end of my essay, and then call it finished. What I did not think about as I was doing that was how clunky it is to put a large quote in the middle of my writing. In the literature class, however, we would often write responses to sections of the books we read, so it is evident that we would need quotes. It got to the point where we were writing something about the book every single day, and every single one of them would require quotes so it eventually became a habit that I would incorporate to all my future writings. There are numerous aspects of my writing that I would absolutely love to get better at. Two examples that I am currently struggling with include staying on the given topic and not rambling, and not writing outlines or rough drafts but rather dive straight into my final copy. I am so thankful that there was never a maximum word count in my high school classes because I would exceed them every single time with my useless comments. I would appreciate it so much if, when my papers are returned, sections that were not needed were highlighted so that I could learn for future papers. My lack of writing rough drafts and outlines is because I am very lazy, and I put things off until later. By the time 'later' comes, I have no time to write an outline and just write my final copy in one sitting; most of the time I don't even go back and reread the paper. These are terrible habits that I hope to kick before I start a real college paper. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brianne Hansson ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I tend to be very good at making sure the direction I'm heading in is clear by addressing my answer to the prompt right in the introduction. It is important as a reader to be able to decipher the main message easily out of the whole piece of writing, which is what the introduction is for; answering the question and then using the rest of the essay to explain yourself through evidence. I learned to emphasize the main idea of my essays through a history teacher I had all throughout high school. No matter what the essay was about my teacher always made it clear to start your essay with a "road map." The road map would consist of the main question at the top and then underneath would be bullet points of however many answers you were required to give (for example, an essay question could ask you to give 3 solutions to help reduce the effects of climate change, so you would have three bullet points to represent your three solutions). Each bullet point would then represent a paragraph, and this would not only help me to organize my thoughts but it would also make it very clear what I was writing about. In order to execute this method in your writing to now help the reader see your message, the introduction is where you begin. Going back to my example essay prompt about climate change, instead of making your introduction simply a restatement of the question, add another sentence that answers the question. For example, you could finish off your introduction paragraph for this example by saying, "The effects of climate change can be reduced by a single person if they begin carpooling, composting, and showering for less time." The reader now knows your answer to the question, and they can also assume that the following paragraphs will go into further detail about why these methods would reduce climate change. By doing this, my writing has improved immensely.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ A way I would like to improve my writing is through stronger vocabulary. It's easy to just throw your ideas on paper but in my opinion people take you much more seriously when you sound more educated and have a purpose with each word instead of having a lot of unnecessary phrases. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Abigail Harrington ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Abby Harrington Writing priorities Conventions of College writing Something I have always made a point to focus on in my research or reports was to include the opposing side. I think it is important to address the opposing side in the argument because it allows readers to decide which side of the argument they want to agree with. I also think that including the opposing side with substantial research strengthens the claims I want to convey to the reader because it shows my side can go up against another argument. A way that I would revise my work would be using the rubric my English teacher gave me. from what I remember, this rubric gave me the guidelines on how to build and defend a strong argument when compared to the opposing side. an example of this is from my research project I did on animal testing at the end of my junior year. "animals should not be tested on because there are other alternatives that can be used to get similar results." I chose this from my paper because I think it's a good representation of the importance about including both sides of an argument. I think I need a lot of work and improvement for making a stronger claim towards my argument. My reasoning for this is because I think one of the most important things in a paper, and based off my past work its definitely an area that could use some improvement. I think as with all things practice makes perfect, but a way I would work towards improving my claim or argument would be to do more reports on controversial topics that provides a good solid argument. I also think that researching how to use persuasive writings skills to win over the reader to the side that you have decided to defend would be a good way to improve your claim. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexandra Hart ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my academic writing, I have struggled with my thesis statements. Throughout my writing I provide valid evidence and context with interpretations, but without a clear thesis statement, the point of my writing isn't always clearly stated. AS it is often the first few sentences of any piece of writing, it is very important to make sure my writing starts out strong. My senior year English teacher worked with my class and I individually on using a pyramid scheme in my intro/thesis statement. Over the year my writing grew stronger as I got more comfortable with this technique. During my revision process I will read my intro backwards to see if my thesis is truly at the end, or blended through the entire piece. I often would take advantage of peer editing to see if they can see my clear statement, and if not, I know where to move on from. The last report I wrote was a research paper on the Manson Murders. With no clear task at hand, I had to develop a thesis statement on my own based on the research I was doing. On my final draft, my thesis was the effect of Charles Manson on his family members and on society. As the report built, I kept referencing back to my thesis with all the interviews and first hand accounts of Manson. My English teacher told me that he felt it was the strongest piece he had read of mine that year and I grew as a writer. Overall, I still hope to expand my writing and be able to feel more comfortable with reports and making sure all my evidence is tied back to a solid point. The biggest aspect I hope to grow on is my analysis and vocab. While I try to be extensive and find the best terms for my points, I hope to become so comfortable they come to me with little thought, as if they just roll off the tongue. In my analysis, I hope to be able to feel more confident expanding and adding new points. I often hesitate and reread multiple times to make sure I am not headed in the wrong direction too fast or even make sure I'm not restating the same piece repeatedly. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ethan Haubner =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my academic writing that I focus on while revising is my diction, attempting to avoid overused language or repeating phrases. Keeping a smooth flow and non-repetitive diction is a central aspect to all types of writing. I began to focus on this aspect of my writing in my senior year of highschool with my english teacher Mr.Zevenbergen. A good example of this error comes from one of my final essays of the year breaking down a piece of poetry and explaining its elements. The example is from the second paragraph and goes "The imagery of the rod and the reference to volcanos allow the next line to mention how the blacksmith was a god before the machines. The reference to the volcano supports this as only a god could wield the power of one of earth's most powerful spectacles." I used the same word "reference" to point out the same piece of evidence twice. When in the second sentence I could of just switched it up using ''mention'' or ''remark'' to give a better flow to the 2 lines entirely. This essay was used in peer review to expose common mistakes made and was also timed making it so the final copy was the only one written. It allowed me to realize with the timing allowing one copy and the peer review after that this is a common mistake of mine that I will always need to look out for. Word choice not only forms the style of an essay but also tone. Maintaining a stylistic form for easy reading but also a tone that projects professionalism. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward from this previous point in my writing career one aspect I want to now turn my attention to is my accuracy with the prompt itself. I tend to stray off point from the prompt itself listing evidence that is unneeded almost entirely. Or in other cases just missing an entire piece of the prompt. A good way to solve this is just closer revision on my part and referencing the prompt as I read through drafts.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ashley Hausrath ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In everything that I write, I consciously try to focus on a lot of things simultaneously. Usually, I tend to pay the closest attention to the transitions that I choose to use. During my sophomore year of high school, my English teacher dedicated a large portion of our class time to learning about transitions. Transitions were always something that I felt were weak in my writing until this point, so I was more than happy to learn more transitional words and phrases that I would be able to incorporate into my own writing. This significantly improved my writing, and, I feel, took my writing to the next step. Since then, I have gone on to be very particular with my use of transitions. By using key transitional phrases like "however," "although," "nevertheless," and plenty more, I feel like I was able to step up my writing a little bit. I think using effective transitions is essential in order to make sure my writing flows from one idea to the next in a way that makes sense and is easy for the reader to understand. For example, in my recent Diagnostic Essay for INTD 105, I said: "Through discovering what my dream job is, I figured out what I should major in: Communication." If I hadn't had the introductory phrase "through discovering what my dream job is", the rest of the sentence wouldn't have made sense. Along with my use of transitions, I try to focus on my grammar. I know my grammar is not always perfect, but through revising my own work and through getting the right criticism and feedback, I am able to see what I need to improve upon for the next time I write. This is one thing I hope to develop more effectively for writing at Geneseo and beyond. I think there are times where my writing is very accurate grammatically, but there are also plenty of times where I am uncertain if my grammar is right. I think grammar is possibly the weakest area of my writing, but I feel like with adequate practice, I will definitely become stronger with my grammar and with that, I will become more confident in my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicole Hauss ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I precisely focus on the organizational structure of my work because that is how I express the key components of my piece in the best way. An organized essay helps the reader understand the flow and logic of my thoughts. In an introduction, I state the main concern of the essay which conveys the main idea. Writing a thesis statement will properly introduce this idea. My body paragraphs elaborate or give more insight about the main idea, using a topic sentence that tells the reader what aspect of the main idea I will be addressing. I include evidence in the body paragraphs to support my discussion and add a closing statement to emphasize the importance of the paragraph. My conclusion summarizes the essay's thesis. Structure refers to the order of ideas. Essay structure has many effects on a piece, such as transitioning in a clear manner. I structure my text in different ways to interest the reader on my specific topic. My 11th grade AP Composition teacher introduced a childish, yet effective way to organize my pieces. The Hamburger Paragraph Template is a writing organizer that works to visually outline the key aspects of a paragraph. I would draw out a burger on scrap paper, and include all the necessary components of my piece in a chronological format. The bun of the burger is your topic sentence and the details are the tomato. After I layered on more details with the cheese portion, I would add another supporting sentence as my burger. Next, is more lettuce that serves as another detail that connects my topic sentence. The bottom bun represents the closing statement following all the details in each paragraph, reintroducing the main concept. For example, instead of starting my first body paragraph with, "heart disease and lung cancer are long term effects of air pollution," I would begin with the reintroducing the purpose of the paragraph. A better first sentence would be, "air pollution can result in many long term health effects." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [To develop my writing, I must work on expanding my vocabulary. The depth of my vocabulary can influence the descriptiveness, accuracy, and quality of my writing. To make my vocabulary stronger I can think of synonyms for commonly used words in my pieces, and study those alternatives often. Using more descriptive language in my everyday conversations will enable me to incorporate them into my writing as well. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alison Hawryschuk =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I write I tend to go into extreme detail that sometimes can lead to going off topic. I always answer the overall question but it's also the answer to the question and answers to eleven different unasked questions. At some points all the information is relevant for that topic but at others it drifts away from the main idea. For example, my essay for the common application talked about how my grandma passed away when I was in the ninth grade, but I also went off to talk about how my life was like growing up.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ "My grandmother, better known as "Mum," was the closest person to me aside from my parents.

They have given me many pointers and suggestions on how to improve my writing. Strong writing skills can improve everyday activities, from writing emails, writing something for work and especially for the type of career I want to go into ( elementary teacher). I am confident in the fact that I will be able to argue my point and have enough information or personal experience to back up my point.

I like to make sure my writing is organized and fully tied together, so my main point isn't missed. Throughout my high school career, I was taught the basic argumentative essay structure. It includes an introduction with all of your main points as well as support for the other side of the argument, a body paragraph knocking down the other side of the argument, two more body paragraphs with your evidence supporting your argument, and a conclusion. This is something I try to use in all of my writing because with a basic and organized structure, it is easier to follow and makes your argument stronger. I wrote an argumentative essay about the book *Into the Wild,* focusing on the idea that Chris McCandless did what he had to do to live a successful and happy life. I started off my body paragraphs by explaining how some people think he was dumb for going into the Alaskan wilderness as a minimalist, but then countering that claim with my own. "Chris abandoned his car and burned his money, which some found stupid. In all honesty, these sorts of things were necessary to complete his goal," was a sentence from my first body paragraph that shows how I gave the opposing claim, and then my own. This is what I try to incorporate into most of my writing. When editing my drafts, I normally look to make sure that my argument is organized in a way that sells my point the most. Something that I feel needs improvement in my writing is my vocabulary. I often struggle with incorporating new words, and I tend to overuse some words. I think a way to help with this might be to reread my essays more than once. With that, I could find new words and notice the overused ones. I could also see how allowing someone else to read my work could help with pointing out repetitive words and thoughts and finding replacements for my not so developed vocabulary. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Meghan Heeney =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[When creating a piece of writing, no matter the subject, I dedicate a substantial amount of attention to its organization.

I am unsure what grade I got this template of sorts from, but somewhere along the way in high school, I got a template for writing introductory paragraphs that start with a very general statement as the first sentence but then gets more specific as you get closer to what your claim/thesis actually is. This structure helps me focus down into a very specific claim that I can use my other resources for to support it easier than if I didn\'t use this process. An example of how I start one of these paragraphs is saying something general such as this, \"The rule of law seems ingrained in our civilization, a necessity by all accounts.\" I would then narrow down what my topic was many sentences later into something like this, \"\...it can be claimed that the rule of Law is not merely a small part of civilization where men are already aware not to do terrible acts, but is civilization itself where, without the rule of law, men would divulge into their tribality without any morality of their humanity.\" This essay was about how law affected civilization where I first start with a very general statement about law and then slowly divulge into my claim about law and then state the many examples I use to support it, \"John Locke, Cesare Beccaria, and John Swift with their enlightenment ideas and writings show the why, where, and purpose of law clearly, in that the rule of law makes up our morality, and not, morality makes the rule of law.\" A skill I would like to improve upon is integrating my quotes and evidence from the texts better into my body paragraphs as it sometimes feels like they are arbitrarily put into them at weird places rather than having a meaningful position there. I tend to put more thoughts of my own in there and feel like there is not enough evidence in the paragraph to support what I am saying. Going forward I would like to try to integrate my thoughts more with the quotes that I find perhaps a little better than I have in the past. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Anna Hendricks ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [An element of writing that I find crucial to incorporate in mine is analysis. This skill was strengthened for me during my senior year of high school in my AP literature course. For the three preceding years in high school, I thought analysis was a synonym to explaining the text or quotes from an outside source to support your point. That same rationale is why I was shocked when I only scored an eighty on the first essay assignment. My teacher explained to me that citing the text isn't enough to persuade the audience of your point and that analysis was the ability to connect your own original ideas to the text and other people\'s opinions in order to delve into the mechanics behind the author\'s reasoning for writing a specific way. For example, if I were to analyze Ophelia's death in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Hamlet]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, stating the circumstances around it and the impact it had on Hamlet isn't enough to support my thesis that Hamlet truly did love Ophelia and it was not part of his act of madness. However if I dove into the text and not only explained the impact of her death, but how it influenced the play as a whole and Shakespeare reasoning for writing it, then I would have successfully analyzed the text. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I want to focus my writing on incorporation counter-arguments.

This is one of the most common types of writing, when revising my work my goal is to make sure that I am getting the reader\'s attention and convincing the reader to agree with the point I am trying to make. Persuasive writing plays a big part in our everyday lives, from seeing ads on the bus on our way to school, to being persuaded by our counselors to keep better track of our assignments by using a planner in our everyday life. Persuasive writing is considered to be one of the most important techniques by many, this is since it teaches writers how to defend their point. An example of this would be, " Domestic Violence affects children in many different ways. It has been proven that domestic violence affects children academically, physically and emotionally. More than 3 million children from the ages of 3-17 are severely exposed to domestic violence per year". I provide strong evidence most readers can sympathize with. During my AOP summer program, I was given really helpful feedback from my INTD professor and mentor to be able to increase my writing skills, these include, revising over my work to catch grammar errors and citing my sources in a way where it is clear to the readers. Moving forward, I will make challenged myself to use different vocabulary in my writing to increase my writing level. In addition to that, I will also be adding what I have learned on "They Say, I Say" by Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein in my writing, this means I will be adding "their" view to my argument to make it stronger and more effective. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Olivia Herring ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing I try to focus on grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling can have a huge effect on the reader. If I were to spell a word wrong that would be a huge red flag to the reader and they would assume I am not professional at all and would think I was a careless ammature. I worked a lot in my senior year of highschool on punctuation in my writing. My English teacher, Mr. Mullen, helped my a lot on this part of my writing. He gave me lots of tips and taught me the correct uses of grammar, punctuation, and spelling in my writing. Mr. Mullen had a huge impact on my writing skills. He taught me that if punctuation is used correctly then the reader will form a good opinion of me, the author. If I were to use the wrong punctuation it could also change the meaning of something I am trying to say and the reader may misinterpret my writing. In one of my writings I wrote "The results were tampered with and as a result we have to send the tests back to the lab to be reviewed again." I did not use any punctuation at all except for the period at the end. To change this I wrote "The results were tampered with; as a result, we have to send the tests back to the lab to be reviewed again." Changing it makes me look much more professional and will help the reader understand the sentence more clearly. Going forward in my writing I would like to concentrate on the specific words I use. I think I use very dull words that do not make my writing very interesting. I would like to further my vocabulary skills because it will make my writing more interesting and then I would feel much more accomplished and proud of my writing. Using better words is also an opportunity for the reader to establish a good opinion of my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Madelyn Hill ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Madelyn Hill Dr. Paku INTD 106 9/4/19 In my writing, I focus on avoiding run-on sentences and trying to get my point or message across in the least amount of words possible. When a sentence has multiple segments separated by commas, it is very easy to lose the attention of the reader. By either reading the sentence over multiple times or reading it out loud, I can rearrange and edit to deliver the message efficiently. Before I revise my sentences though, I write as long of a sentence as I need so I have more material that I can eliminate or keep until I find the best combination. I learned and practiced this skill the most in my Public Speaking class senior year of high school. Knowing that I needed to present my speeches out loud forced me to edit my sentences more strictly and become more aware of how my sentences sound. An example could be from an argumentative essay I wrote in 11^th ^grade about standardized tests. I said, "If a student chooses what they are learning and are interested in it, they will be more passionate and motivated to learn rather than having information overwhelming them to the point of stress." In this part of my essay, I was trying to make the point of how students would do better in school and on exams if they were not forced to study certain information. I cited my evidence in the sentence prior and then explained why I chose to include that one quote. I was also to tie my explanation in with my main thesis in this one sentence. Another example is the first sentence of my concluding paragraph, "In conclusion, considering all of the incompetent study strategies, discouragement of students, and inaccurate representation of achievement, one can safely say that standardized testing is not beneficial to students in any part of their educational lives." Here I wanted to state the main points of each piece of evidence while fitting it all into one sentence. In the future, being able to make my point using more descriptive words and phrases rather than listing adjectives for example, would be extremely beneficial to my writing. In my opinion, I feel that my vocabulary and familiarity to literary phrases and words tend to hold me back when I want to illustrate a point. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Carly Hoffman =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [I continuously focus on making sure that I use direct quotes correctly when I revise my drafts. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[Direct quotes are important because you want to be able to tell your readers that you have a credible saying by a credible source. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[My old English teacher at my high school continuously drilled into our heads how to properly cite quotes and to make sure that we ]{data-contrast="auto"}[cited]{data-contrast="auto"}[ correctly every time we cited quotes.]{data-contrast="auto"}[ When I used to bring my old drafts to my English teachers, they would tell me how I should cite my quotes.

I always start off with an introductory sentence and then begin stating my main ideas for each paragraph. Then in each paragraph I usually will look for quotes to support my main idea and after each quote I would explain how that quote supports my main idea. This skill was shown to me by my eleventh grade teacher by giving an outline that I would follow and I just continued to write in that form. This skill is important because it shows that I know how to show evidence to support my main ideas. For an example, I would start off a paragraph with, "From when children are born to when they are adults, there are these expectations that society likes to put on someone's gender" and then I would follow that with a quote that supports my statement, "'Expecting the same things of all people is simply illogical; the differences of each individual create a personal flare that is not comparable to others' (Petty)".

In my point of view, proper words and clear sentences help me to provide strong supports for my points, and moreover, they make the essay more reliable. As an international student from Japan, it is obvious that I have fewer vocabularies than others. Thus, oftentimes, it is challenging for me to come up with a short-enough sentence to explain everything I would like to point out. With this point, to prove that my skills are reached an academic level, I carefully check if I use suitable words on my essay or not. For instance, in my first semester, I took Writing 101 which is the basic academic writing class for international students. In the class, I submitted an essay assignment about plagiarism. On my essay I wrote "That will be, of course, big trouble called plagiarism." However, the professor pointed out that the part was wordy, and I could shorten it such as "That is, of course, plagiarism." She told the students to write sentences as short as possible, as it helps to sounds professional. Also, to deal with this problem, I often look up analogy words. For example, the verb \"get\" takes a lot of meaning. Depends on content the word is used in, it would be \"go\", \"achieve\", \"be provided\", \"comprehend\", and more and more. Thus, if I do not use appropriate words, I have to explain more on my paper. Because of that, it is important to find one particular word for a topic: a vocabulary which perfectly supports my idea reduce vagueness of my intention and furthermore, wordiness on my essay. If a person repeats the same word on an essay, I found that people are less willing to seeing the quality and reliability of her/his concepts. As my writing professor told me, even though he/she has an excellent point, a wordy and unrefined sentence negatively contributes to the impression people have to the work. Sentences become boring and less respected by readers. To avoid such a result, I would like to develop my writing skills more, especially focusing on academic vocabularies. If you ask me, reading academic essays and practical writing experiences help me to learn more patterns of word-using. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Makayla Horne =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on many different traditional aspects of writing when forming papers and other pieces. One major focus I have is that I always make sure to add adequate information and cite my sources. It is necessary to include your own information after citing another person's information to avoid plagiarism. I know of Geneseo's extensive plagiarism consequences and that is definitely not a mistake that I want to make. It is important to always cite the information correctly by including the original author's last name in parentheses followed by the page number. This is an important skill to have not only in college but for everyday writing after that as well. One should always know who and where the information comes from so then there is no stealing (plagiarism). Even outside of college, plagiarism is treated as a crime. There are fines revolved around it. Using the website Turnitin in high school helped me become a better writer by not including as much information from other sources. This website reads through your essay and highlights all of the areas where plagiarism could have been committed. I found this to be a very helpful tool when writing research papers for my pre-AP English class my sophomore year. I used it for the first time for this class. My teacher wanted to teach us how to properly write a paper without plagiarizing. It showed me where I needed more of my own thoughts added in. I followed the suggestions that the website gave me and changed up my paper and cited everything again properly. Sometimes, it even highlights pieces of your paper that are quoted and cited correctly, so I double-checked those sentences before resubmitting. I haven't really used the website since, however, I feel as if it is very important and helpful to use in college to avoid getting in trouble. One thing I could improve upon is not using as many sources and to add in more of my thoughts as stated above. I will use Turnitin more often to check my work and see which parts I need to add my thoughts and ideas to. I will always check carefully for plagiarism because that is not something I want to be accused of. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kaleb Hotaling ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Kaleb Hotaling\ INTD 106 When I look back at my writing from High School, I realize my flow if my writing has not changed much over the years. It feels as if it is still choppy and lacks a fluidity that would make as if one is actually reading a legitimate paper. By improving the flow of my writing it would help with the cohesion of the sentences and paragraphs. Improving my word choices at the end of a sentence would help set up a transition into the next to better ease the reader as well. Previously in the past I have had teachers who've helped students like me combat this issue by reading aloud sentences or slow down and read how each word is connected to the next. This may seem as a small fix but goes along way in getting my point across. For example an excerpt from an essay I wrote in 11th grade. "John Dewey had a lasting impact on education during the 20th century that could also be looked at today", this sentence helps start the following "Dewey believed that the successful classroom teacher possesses a passion for knowledge and an intellectual curiosity in the materials and methods they teach".

When writing an argument, it can become a challenge to use complex words and sentences that relate strictly back to my claim. When\ I wrote a short response to an argument in my INTD 105 class, I made a claim that the stereotypical athletes weren't just uneducated and self-centered, but they are very intelligent, respectful, and unselfish. I then concluded my short argument by mentioning that if you were to meet an athlete, perhaps you would see that they are very outgoing. My professor revised my paper by mentioning that outgoing was a singular trait in its own, and had no relation to being intelligent, respectful, and unselfish. After talking to her about that, I realized that I needed a specific word or phrase that not only wrapped up my argument but related specifically back to the claim I had made. I decided to change up the phrase by saying "if you get a chance to meet and talk with some athletes, you would possibly see how well-mannered they are." Not only did this revision flow better, but it also related to the three traits more effectively than the word outgoing After becoming aware of and acknowledging this skill, I have come to realize just how important it is. Whether you're supporting a claim with evidence or just an opinion, the writing piece should always connect. I've learned that the best pieces of work have sentences that flow and always connect back to the overarching claim. As I continue to develop as a writer, learning new skills such as developing a solid and specific thesis in the introduction would relate directly to the skill I mentioned before. If you I continued to be clear and specific about related words and phrases back to my claim, while also having a strong thesis, I should see a lot of improvement in my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Madison Hoyt ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Madison Hoyt September 5, 2019 Self-Reflection Growing up writing was never my strong suit.

As I got older my writing skills evolved and I began to finally grasp my writing skills. One thing I've always thought I was good at was, relating to the audience or the readers. I have a more laid-back writing style and have used it to my advantage to persuade my readers. This is an important skill to have because it helps keep the reader engaged and want to read more. It is also important to use when applying for a job or even college. Most people, including myself, use this technique in their college application essays to persuade them to let you attend their institution. In my college essay I talked about struggles I have had throughout my life and the lessons I have learned about myself through these struggles. This helped show the reader that when faced with an obstacle such as a tough class or illness I would be able to overcome the obstacle. These techniques must have worked because I was accepted to all the colleges I applied to. Even though I have come a long way I still have some things I could improve on.

One year in particular that really helped me grow in writing was my junior year. While getting ready for the English Regents and fitting in all the content of the curriculum at the same time, I was able to pick up a lot of useful techniques. I really improved on my sentence variety and my vocabulary through the year. During my writing I tended to get stumped as I would try to think of complex structures and words in the moment; however, my teacher showed us that it was better to write out the main points of the writing first and revise later. This was very helpful in that my ideas began to flow more smoothly when I wrote. I could put my ideas down before worrying if they were good enough. Later I gathered all my writing techniques and structures together and incorporated them into my piece. I also changed basic words like "good" or "bad" to more advanced vocabulary like "thriving" or "poor". I started my writing process with a simple unedited sentence: "The idea of comfortable lifestyles with luxuries is becoming smaller because the high debt rates". After the editing process my new sentence became, ""The aspect of a comfortable lifestyle with luxuries is being diminished considering the high debt rates". I learned to restructure sentences while improving my vocab options. After much practice, these skills became natural to me and I had many more sophisticated words to work with. My writing improved dramatically, and I grew because of it. I now focus on advancing my sentence structures and vocabulary consciously as I revise my drafts in writing. One aspect I want to effectively develop while writing at Geneseo and beyond is writing academic essays without sounding elementary like and using the basic "five paragraph structure".

I've just always been told to avoid too many of these terms in order to avoid ruining the flow or adding "clunkiness" to an already satisfactory work. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Something I've struggled with, however, is being concise. From a young age, my writing has tended to drag on and on with far too much added fluff. So with a bit of a push from my A.P. Language/Literature teacher, I believe I've been improving. I've made a point to eliminate those unnecessary aspects of my work. It's a terrible habit I've always had - that deep desire to make every single sentence I write beautiful and witty. But it tends to be that when trying too hard, arrogance oftentimes is interpreted in place of intelligence. Hence why there's wit. It's short: to the point. Like a great punchline. Yet wit isn't to be overused, or else it'll become redundant and simply devalue the whole work. So I've had to learn to use it in moderation, which due to struggling with concision, tends to be easier than not.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In any case, I believe that I am a pretty conscious writer, and attempt to put as much effort as I can into each and everything I write.

Personally over the courses of the two semesters I have been here at Geneseo, I believe the way I incorporate quotes towards the arguments or statements have been done very well. This is a very important aspect of writing especially for history, because it helps prove the point you are trying to make. Without providing actual evidence in your assignments it can take away from your argument. My AP Euro teacher Mr. Harrigan, was one of the many individuals who helped me with this concept. He helped me shape this skill by showing me how to do it, how to cite it, and also how this was useful in history writing or writings in general. Recently for homework in one of my history classes I quoted, "can you have globalization without gunboats?" This quote was very important for the text and I thought it was one of the author\'s main points in the reading. I then continued to explain the quote and its meaning to the text. I also cited the quote using Chicago Style Citation which is very important in history essays. Overall for the class work I took the quote from was a pretty informal writing piece, as it\'s just a reflection and doesn't require it to be super important. So my editing process for the piece was just to read over it twice and make changes here and there regarding on how I felt the writing piece flowed. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect I would really like to develop more would be explaining better or regarding more information after the quote.

I make sure that there is no abrupt ending to my thought and make sure that a sentence, phrase, or a quote makes sense in where it was placed in my writing or if it needs to get deleted because it does not fit in my essay and throws the whole essay off. I believe that I can use the correct transition word or phrase to move the sentence a long and where a sentence I think goes in the correct place in my writing. I can use the transition template that I received in twelfth grade to better my understanding of where a transition word or phrase should or should not go and whether or not a quote belongs where it was written. This skill is important because my essay may flow nicely together causing it to make sense. For example like using these sentences, \"[There are many women that did have an abortion it was not that they did not want a baby it was that their pregnancy was negatively affecting their health, they were at risk of dying, or they could not afford to take care of a baby and abortion was just easier to do rather than put it up for adoption.

So I try to limit it to a few words and the most important parts of the quote that help prove my point and better my paper. Also deciding what quotes to put in my paper is a crucial factor because they can either really enhance my argument or statement or hinder it. I learned the majority of my skills on how to pick and choose what to include and how to embed quotes from my eleventh grade high school teacher, as I used to struggle with the concept of embedding quotes and would simply add large parts without any transition into my paper. This added no benefit to the papers I wrote and caused them to lack persuasion. I try to blend the quoted parts into my words as best as possible. So for example in an anthropology paper I wrote about food production and domestication. Early humans "unconsciously dispersed the plants" which then put them on the "road to domestication" (GGS:119).

One being my transitions from one topic to the next I can find myself struggling to find a way to make a smooth transition into the next topic and find my essay sounding choppy at times. Another area while quite basic that I would like to work on is grammar. I find myself overlooking the simpler parts of my essay which end up making a paper that was good into something that had a lot of simple mistakes that could have easily been fixed.

It can be rather difficult, because if I have too much detail, as is often the case, my writing appears bloated and full of redundancies. However, a lack of detail is often regarded as the anathema to a well-written piece; thus, balance is key. This fact has been reinforced all through high school by my parents, both of whom are teachers. I remember struggling to finely trim the detail in my 12th grade English essay on whether video games can serve to sway an individual towards violence. I was terrified of being short on details and eventually filled nearly 6 pages with multiple redundant lines and extra sentences that served no purpose. After almost 2 hours of editing I was able to trim it down to 4 pages and still have a suitable argument against the claim the videogames cause violence and aggression in kids and teens. In the future, I think I'd like to work on my grammar and sentence structure, as autocorrect on word processors can't fix everything. I'm not incapable of using correct wording and tenses, but having a more thorough understanding of the various methods that can be used to word an argument will likely serve me well in the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Elena Johnson =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Something that I continuously stride to do correctly; is writing a well rounded and rehearsed thesis. The thesis is one of the most essential parts of any written document. It aids the reader in knowing beforehand what it is that they are about to read and from what perspective. A consistent and well thought out thesis will set the tone for any written work. When thinking about a specific technique that helped me I am reminded of my tenth grade history teacher. He had me picture both the thesis and the conclusion to be in the shape of a cone. A thesis/introduction starts off with the more general information, but is then brought down to a concise sentence. While the formation of a conclusion would be the opposite of the introduction. For example in my argumentative essay for eleventh grade english I changed my more general claim of, "technological advances are created to better the lives of the people who utilize them". To a more specific point with an added counterclaim, "Despite claims about self-driving cars creating job loss and issues in security, they should replace human drivers because it will aid in fewer accidents and develop a more efficient environment". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An element of my writing that I would like to work on is my way introducing and explaining a quotes.

This strength of mine allows me to help the readers understand the point of the author's work before I go on make my argument on whether or not I agree or disagree with their views. Also being able to pepper in quotes from their text and analyze it allows me to paint a picture of why exactly I am making a particular argument.

I was able to highlight how the main point of the way that the documentary used narratives and reinforced it using the talent of actors helped viewers to develop a newer perspective on the slaves that hit closer to home. This allowed me to use the summary to bring in my point about how creative minds of the present can use art as the top way to transcend slave history in order to reimagine it and shape different thoughts around the subject.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ I used quotes like ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}["forced her to stand for hours knitting and if she even closed her eyes once to rest, she'd hit her across the head with a switch!"

This highlighted the point of the documentary while also explaining my opinion on the doc. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[This skill is important for the simple fact that it enables the reader to better understand the point of the arguments discussed within the essay. It makes my intentions for writing clear and easy to follow. Since the commencement of my INTD 105 class, I have been reading "They Say, I Say" by Gerald Graft and Cathy Birkenstien. This book is a kind of writer's handbook with the objective of teaching the proper fundamentals to next level writing. The author's introduce the terms "they say" and "I say". They Say, is a way to refer to writing or ideas that come from others. It could be information from novels, textbooks, scholarly journals, or even simply words from the mouth of a friend. "I Say" on the other hand is how you write your arguments and opinions of the "They Say" in an effective way. I came to realize while reading just how important summarizing the "They Say" is when it comes to making my arguments better.

Learning to both retain the reader's interest as well as maintain a comprehensive and easily followed stream of ideas has drastically changed my approach to writing an effective paper. During my first years of detailed informational writing, I tended to take the interest of my readers in the introduction and whip it wildly around in an incoherent mess of scattered ideas. Because I struggled with this problem somewhat early on, I was able to overcome it through careful attention and predictive thought, thus strengthening my ability to compose a worthwhile essay. For example, in an extended essay I wrote in my second year of the International Baccalaureate program at my high school I had included in my introduction this excerpt: "\...there is much to explore\... in order to examine and analyse the\... climate that controlled the lives, both in the short and long term, of these\... creatures." My statement, placed in the middle of my introduction, was implemented because of help from my advisor, as it includes the boundaries of my essay as a whole yet it conveys specific themes. Through the help from both my advisor for the aforementioned essay as well as my learning curriculum in middle school, I was able to turn my most potent deficiency in writing into one of my most useful skills. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As exemplified through my own experience, neglecting to at least ponder how each idea one generates relates to the intended central goal for the essay will leave the reader confused and uncertain of the points being weakly expressed. If one is able to weave a strong, effective web for their readers to entrap themselves in by consistently and correctly, the central theme will become more apparent, and the little knots of ideas supporting that theme will be strengthened by each other. It is thus imperative that one implements some stage of mental planning when composing any sort of written work.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Despite my growth in that certain area, I always have skills that can be improved, the foremost of which is my management of the space and time I use when composing a piece of work.

A major influence in my ability to construct a strong thesis was my 12th grade English teacher, Mrs. Deidre Gordon. During one extra help session, I was struggling to create a direct thesis when writing an essay about the literary devices in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Charlotte Brontë's ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Jane Eyre. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[She described a strong thesis as an argumentative statement, that is not too broad but can be broken down into multiple examples that support your thesis in order to have a well written academic piece.

An idea needs to be able to be fully supported to maximize its significance. As a result of her advice, I am now able to establish a ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[thesis statement and I am able to use evidence provided by what I have read and I am able to dig deeper and come up with insights that relate to and support the main purpose of my academic piece. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An example of such would be, when writing an essay about the literary devices used in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Charlotte Brontë's ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Jane Eyre]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, I am able to take a statement such as "Charlotte Brotë uses metaphors throughout the novel" and I can revise and expand the statement to "Charlotte Brotë uses metaphors throughout the novel to highlight Jane's feelings of suppression in a patriarchal society".

I spent the majority of my high school career writing research papers, ranging from topics of animal cruelty to Charlotte Bronte\'s *Jane Eyre*. In my writing, I find that I try to compress as much information in as possible without overwhelming the thesis, or my paper. Organization of information is key with these papers, and I\'d like to think I have a fairly good understanding of this. In a research paper focusing on social situations in James Joyce\'s *Dubliners,* my English teacher commented on the craft of my paper, and it\'s organization. As a writer, I\'d like to think this is the area in which I\'ve developed the most. Unfortunately, argumentative essays have never gone that well for me. My entire eleventh-grade year in English was based around argument (AP English Language and composition), and I struggled quite a bit. I think my main problem was developing a strong enough thesis to craft my argument around. I would be able to obtain information for my essay, cite said information, and organize it into well-developed paragraphs- but my thesis always lacked. My teacher and I spoke about it a few times and ultimately concluded that I needed to look deeper into my argument. We did exercises in class that helped quite a bit but I still struggle with it. In my future writing, I\'d like to try and develop my thesis writing skills, as well as learn new techniques to introduce information. These techniques are important for more than one reason. The thesis is the most important part of a paper because it gives it a central idea- and lets the reader know what they should be expecting. Introducing information in a well thought out and coherent way is also important, as it gives the paper "flow". I enjoy the way my information gets organized, but there\'s always room for improvement. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Carissa Junz ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In most of my essays, I keep a steady focus on smooth transitions between pieces of quoted texts for evidence, and relating it back to my main idea.

It also helps the tone to sound more engaging so that the reader pays more attention and the structure is not repetitive. This was something I used to struggle with and my teacher helped me phrase my sentences in an easier way.

Although my high school English teacher brought this to my attention and showed me examples of past essays that did so, I couldn't figure out how to draw the readers in and struggled to make a connection to something other than the topic of my paper.

I served as my high school debate clubs 35th Treasurer & spoke at countless events. The art of public speaking is one that isn't easy to master, however one thing I found that made it not only easier to rebut points but gain respect was the words I choose & how they were used. In 11th grade English I had a teacher Frank Nappi, who is a renowned author & has been in the New York Times Best seller page. He was able to show me how to properly use synonyms, where to take out unnecessary words/phrases & overall was able to show me how to write in a more elegant style. One example of him helping me was last fall I was writing a paper on "The Great Gatsby". I went to say something along the lines of "Nick was having a good time at the party" however Nappi encouraged me to use words like enjoyable or satisfactory in place of good. 11th grade English was a time that my skills grew however I cannot stress enough I still have a lot to learn in terms of writing & word choice The types of words you use are crucial to one\'s writing but also important in daily life as just talking to people requires a fair amount of understanding of words and thus can impact how you do in terms of things like job interviews. As I improve my skills one thing I hope to get better at is my spelling skills. I have found over the years although not poor, I will sometimes look up a simple word to make sure I spell it correctly or even use my computer\'s microphone to spell out words I am completely unsure of how to spell.

That would be the logical thing to do, right? But it's always more complicated than that. I have written many papers, and learned much from my past mistakes. From those mistakes, I learned a lot on how to write properly, and certain things just somehow been drilled into my head . I often received positive feedback on my ability to find and create examples in my writing, as well as create good ideas to base the paper off of. A valued writing skill that I believe I possess is the ability to revise well. When I write my first draft, it is always bad, I know that. However, after the revising process, the original draft, and my final product, can be completely different. For example, in one of my papers, which was about how smartphones and technology degrade intelligence, after I wrote the first draft, I realized there were repeating sentences, using certain words too often, and the argument of the essay wasn\'t quite clear. However, after numerous trials of editing and revising, I was able to organize my ideas, provide synonyms, correct grammar and spelling, and rearrange essentially my entire essay. You would think when comparing the two that they were written by different people. However, what I lack, is when I create ideas, I either have room to expand, or expand on them too late. I realize when you expand on an idea far into the work, it may lose the reader's attention. As my professor wrote down, "The essay is effective and has good examples at the papers end. Try to introduce wordings earlier, to hold the reader's attention." Moving on, I really want to improve on pinpointing those specific details that makes a text interesting and flow. I am hopeful studying at Geneseo will help me improve on it, and if I seek out help and work hard, it will improve. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jason Kagan ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [O]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ne aspect of academic writing I've focused on is transitions.

My last two English teachers in high school stated that I was really good at transitions and it should be the least of my worries. Even with those statements, I always worry about them and would edit them countless times. One example was for my Fantasy Lit class senior year in high school. For about three hours, I kept changing one line of the story we were tasked in creating to help the story flow better. Another example of this is for my research essays. For a final grade in English, we would have to write a research essay. "While the heroes have their own selfish and greedy intentions, the villain Smaug also has some greedy intentions. Smaug is the living personification of greed." The following quote was the topic sentence of my Hobbit research paper. This line helped the flow of the essay go smoothly from one idea to another. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of writing I want to work on is my constant doubt. When I would write an essay or a story, I would write a paragraph, delete the paragraph, write another paragraph, then write a second paragraph, delete both paragraphs, and scrap the idea completely and start over. This wastes incredible amounts of time and effort and has been a result of my absence in school to finish essays and nights of no sleep. This issue stems off of lack of knowledge. I would like to improve my note taking for essays, my understanding of the subject, and build a strategy on how to write a good essay. I would like to start building my writing skills from the ground up in order to improve myself as a whole. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hayley Kahnis =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I feel like in high school I was always a strong writer. All of my teachers have enjoyed my writing and while I have gotten some critiques it always comes along with positive feedback. I have never written a paper that was totally off topic and a total mess. I enjoyed English class and always had good ideas. I feel like I never have trouble coming up with something to write and I am also pretty good at writing about readings I have done in class. I can usually write a lot and never had much trouble struggling to find the right words. I have also always had a strong vocabulary but I feel there is always room for improvement and I would like to continue to expand my vocabulary. Something I would like to improve upon is my punctuation. I feel like I never really know when to use commas so I avoid them. I know when to use apostrophes and periods but I have always had trouble with placing commas. Another thing I could improve on is staying on track. Sometimes while writing I feel I get sidetracked and think of other things to write and just try to spill it all onto my page as fast as I can. This also leads to being a bit unorganized in my writing. While I always try to organize it by the time I\'m turning in my final draft sometimes I feel it is still a little bit all over the place. When I was in 10th grade I had a teacher named Ms. Favre. Ms. Favre has been the most helpful teacher I have ever had. She taught me the importance of keeping my work all in the same tense. In the past I really struggled with this. I wouldn't pay attention to if my work was in past or present tense consistently. Surprisingly Ms. Favre was the first teacher to bring this up to me although I had been making this mistake my entire life. I would switch tenses almost every sentence. She even made time to sit down with me and go over how to fix this and helped me look through past essay to realize my mistake. It is extremely important to keep your work in the same tense because if you don't the timeline of events in your essay will be all over the place and won't make sense. Your reader won't know if these things have happened, or are happening now. Ms. Favre is the only teacher who has ever made a really long lasting effect on my work and even though I still make mistakes with tense in my work I always try my best to go back and think of what she taught me. ]{.s1} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sydney Kammerman ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Sydney Kammerman]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Ever since I was little I've always had trouble with grammar and wanted to fix it. In middle school I was never a fan of english class so I never felt motivated to work on my grammar. Then in 8th and 9th grade I had two fantastic teachers who made me value and appreciate english class. Sophomore year of high school, I decided to take a harder english class. This teacher was the hardest teacher in my school, and she basically had a grammar boot camp and hard quizzes to force the curriculum into our brains. The class was the hardest class I've ever taken but I feel like I have learned so much. Without that teacher I would have never improved this much on my grammar. I remember one specific grammar essay I kept messing up the "there's" so she wrote a little note on the side with a way to remember the difference between them. Ever since then I have been able to differentiate them. Ever since that class I truly realized how important good grammar is. Having good grammar helps you with writing and also with having conversations with people, which is a very important characteristic to have. For example, if someone reads and or writes with bad grammar its very unprofessional and that's why I want to work on my grammar more.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward, I would like to master how to successfully cite a quote from a book. I've always had trouble citing anything for a while now, and would get points off for incorrect citing in a lot of my previous essays. So, learning the proper way to cite a quote will help me now and in the future. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cameron Kane ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I try not to use passive voice unnecessarily in my writing. I find that my work becomes too wordy and unclear when I fail to use active voice. Active voice is a strong, direct way of writing in which the subject performs an action. By focusing on the subject, I find my writing becomes more robust and concise. During my senior year of high school, my English teacher harped upon my overuse of passive voice incessantly. I can only be thankful for his persistence, because it takes constant effort to successfully remind myself of this key skill when I am writing. For my freshmen seminar class, I wrote an essay about the American justice system and its shortcomings. On the issue of overworked defense attorneys agreeing to unfair plea bargains for their clients I wrote, \"The right to a fair trial is all too often replaced by an unfair deal, and the right to an attorney is mangled as well.\" I use passive voice twice in this sentence. I claim that a fair trial *is* replaced and the right to an attorney *is* mangled. Even though I am trying to speak forcefully here, effectively accusing America\'s legal system of failing its citizens, my use of passive voice makes these failures sound blameless. As if unfair deals and mangled rights simply happen naturally. I believe that developing my skills as a writer will help me become a better communicator throughout my life. Well-spoken individuals can get their point across more easily and make their intentions understood more effectively. In the future, I want to do a better job of fleshing out the ideas I write about. I think that I often have several points that I want to cover in an essay, but I end up only fully explaining one or two of them. Instead of mentioning so many different aspects of an issue, I will slow down and write about the complexities of each point in detail. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Liam Kassl ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As I sit here and think to myself about my academic writing career, I come across a reoccurring thought that I have been getting better and better with writing throughout the end of high school. I would not be able to write an essay freshman year and as time went on it became easier and easier, however this is not what this assignment is about. I am instructed to write about one aspect of writing that I have purposely focused on when writing and editing papers and drafts. When writing, I focus mainly on being proper with my grammar and punctuation. I do this because when I write, I love to use commas and semicolons. However, I often fail to use them correctly and I always work on that portion of my writing to fix it which would lead me to be better at writing overall. I was introduced to the proper use of different types of punctuation in 10^th^grade. I was writing an essay in English and my teacher was reading over my rough draft and opened me up to the idea of using semicolons in some specific spots and she had explained to me why I should put a semicolon in a specific spot. That teacher ended up becoming my mentor for my Extended Essay assignment and she wrote one of my letters of recommendation. An example where I had used a proper semicolon in a sentence is as follows: "We had too many turnovers; we lost the game 10-9 in overtime." That was one sentence from an assignment in 10^th^grade when we had to write about our weekend experience and I had a lacrosse tournament which is not important. What is important is that the semicolon was used correctly because it was connecting two things that could have been written in two different sentences, or also known as two independent clauses. Going forward with my Geneseo writing career, I hope to strengthen my grammar and punctuation skills to a point where I am not changing anything about punctuation or grammar in my drafts for assigned papers. I hope to become a stronger writer overall and boost my grades in writing classes by practicing. 368 Words ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cole Kattan ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Cole Kattan]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [I believe that over the course of my academic career, I have improved gradually and consistently nearly every year. It\'s hard to focus on improving every aspect of my writing at once. Whenever I begin a new writing project I'll choose one aspect to focus on. A recent example of this is on an essay during the beginning of senior year that I got back, while I was going over the comments my teacher pointed out to me, that I would use the same words over and over again, and even in some instances the same exact sentence structure. Looking at this in the comments my teacher left it seemed so obvious but when I read it over before handing the paper in, it never crossed my mind. In this specific paper I said the word "and" nearly every other sentence. On my next paper I would check to see how my sentences looked after every couple lines and noticed I was still doing it the same thing. This time I was able to notice it and fix it though. Ever since then I'm being more conscious of this stuff and now it\'s gotten to the point where I hardly make that mistake anymore. This is an example of how I try to improve my writing, I make a deliberate decision to work on a specific aspect of my writing and it corrects itself over time. Correcting this error was really rewarding and I look forward to doing the same types of things at Geneseo. The main issue with my writing that I would like to solve at Geneseo, is getting the words from my head onto the paper in a way that's easily understandable. I feel like I have great ideas in my mind but they never make it onto the paper in the best way. Teachers have even said this to me, and I've been trying to get better about it since I started writing. Teachers would circle things on my paper because they didn't really understand what I was trying to say about something. Then I would go to them and explain what I meant and they would think that it's a really good point or idea that hadn't crossed their mind. So overall at Geneseo I want to learn how to best articulate on to the paper the ideas I have in my head. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Keenan ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} While editing my papers and essays, I tend to add more detail or change any words that are continuously repeated throughout the report. If the same words are repeated several times or if I was able to explain something in as least words as possible, the work can often become boring and the reader will lose interest. Therefore, it is important to have variation in the words but that is being used. When using more advanced and diverse vocabulary, it can often be easier to decrease the amount of detail provided but still get the same point across in a more engaging way. I believe that this can be reached by using a thesaurus when needed or by brainstorming other vocabulary words. I have been advised many times to make these changes by my sisters and by previous teachers. I have been told many times by my sister to avoid using the same words over and over again and to avoid adding any unnecessary details. An example from a paper that I previously wrote would be "Norway also has a large amount of precipitation, which is created by mainly windows which come from the West." I then make the needed corrections to make the sentence as short and interesting as possible by changing and removing any unnecessary words. After making these changes the statement becomes "Norway also has high levels of precipitation which is created by the mainly western winds." In the future, I would like to improve the sections of my papers where I use in-text citations, I would like to improve how I introduce and explain the quotations. I want to ensure that it is completely relevant to my topic and add as much detail as possible as to why I chose to include it. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Kehoe ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a writer, I tend to focus most on making sure every piece of my thesis is supported throughout my writing, as that creates a more concise flow of ideas and progression of my thought process as I try to support my claim. A good complex thesis provides a purpose and a guideline for the whole paper. When I go through and revise, I sometimes realize that maybe I could have worded my initial thought differently in order to give each paragraph a specific topic which would then strengthen the paper as a whole. I feel that having a complex, yet impactful thesis is the entire foundation for a good paper. I once wrote a paper about the play ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Waiting For Godot]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, I chose my thesis to be something along the lines of "life lacks meaning and purpose unless it is lived in the company of others". After reevaluating, I noticed that my thesis was vague and my paragraphs did not necessarily have good enough support or focus enough to prove my thesis. I went on to change my thesis to "Through the use of diction and mood, the author conveys that the company of others is an essential aspect of life which is used as a distraction for the uncertainties and inevitability that lies ahead." I further went on to construct my paragraphs in a way that focused each one solely on the ways that diction is used to convey my claim and how mood was used to support my claim as well, using examples from the text. My twelfth grade English teacher was the one to really reinforce this whole concept to me, as she would leave notes on my papers after reading them, making suggestions pertaining to my thesis and its relation to the rest of my writing. Following this experience, I feel that my writing has strengthened, just upon adopting this skill. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I could further develop in the areas of elaborating upon my evidence and connecting it in a stronger way to my claims. The evidence that I use almost always will be something that goes with the point I\'m trying to prove, however, I sometimes struggle with following up and providing an explanation for my quotes. Explaining more about why I chose those quotes and what really made them stick out would most likely be the best way to support my use of them.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Keller ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Matt Keller]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflective Essay]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing I've always tried to do in my writing, whether it be for school or for some extracurricular activity, is to make it interesting to read. It could be through language or metaphors or whatever else, but an objective that seems to work in my favor is giving the essay deeper meaning than whatever the prompt is. For example, in a past research essay I would use my topic (which was school vouchers) as a segway to both argue my side and also depict deeper problems in modern society. "School vouchers not only show a misuse of our limited education budget, but also the degradation of our Constitution. Overall, this is a small example of a bigger picture problem." School vouchers is something that most people would not categorize as a massive problem plaguing our country, but by throwing in something like a Constitutional dilemma, it is easier to draw the reader onto my side. This skill originates from teachers telling classes that they need a voice in their essays, and that making small remarks or opinionated statements like this they can make the essay stand out.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [That said, these teachers were still totally against the use of first-person pronouns.

Coming back to it after six years, I believe, will be the hardest thing for me to do. I'd like to believe that this essay is the first stepping stone, but it may be rough to begin.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Luke Kelly ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of my writing that I am always very conscious about is the ability to use extremely descriptive adjective and adverbs when describing people, events, and places in my writing. This skill is important because colorful imagery and word usage can really grasp the attention of the reader. The difference between using an ordinary word such as \"loud\" and strong synonym such as \"emphatic\" can be the difference between attracting the attention of the audience or allowing the audience to lose interest. Colorful imagery is extremely important because it makes the reader feel more involved and allows the reader to have a genuine sense of what is happening. The best advice I received on the usage of colorful imagery in writing was from my high school Creative Writing teacher. He would teach me to review my work and always look for ways to bolster a sentence by using a stronger synonym for the word. To use an example from the last piece of writing I wrote from INTD 105- naval conflicts, I wrote, \"Although we had no idea of the chaos going on around us, the deafening sounds of cannon balls and explosions pierced our ears and frightened us to the core.\" I originally wrote that sentence using words like \"loud\" instead of \"deafening\" and \"heard\" instead \"pierced our ears\". After reviewing my work I thought I could make that sentence more vivid to the reader so I used more meaningful adjectives to grasp the audience. One aspect of my writing that I have always struggled with that I hope to improve on is having a better introduction and thesis statement to set the tone for the rest of my writing. In most of my writing career I have been told most of the essay is written well, but the introduction struggled to set up the writing for the body and conclusion. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jonathan Kelsch ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Jonathan Kelsch While I was in High School One thing I learned in my AP and honors English classes was how Important it is was to my teachers and how important it was to me to find a unique stance to write about when answering a prompt. In taking AP classes timed writings were extremely important. These essays were scored one through nine when I first wrote these, I would often score in the middle of the pack anywhere from a four to a six and this was often because I attempted to talk about too many points. So, what my teachers feedback taught me and what I try to keep in mind when I write academically is to focus in on a few important points and really perfect those rather than summarizing a bunch of points that I don't have time or the space to truly analyze. For example, sometimes in my English classes we would have to discuss rhetorical strategies used by authors to convey their message. I would often times list off four or five rhetorical strategies. Once my class had to read an essay by Gandhi and then analyze his rhetorical strategies, in my first writing of the essay I included four or five strategies I cited \"Gandhi's use of the appeals, his diction, his imagery, and his sentence structure.\" Using too many points lead to an unorganized essay so when I wrote it the next time I focused more on the appeals and his diction and was able to score higher on the paper. Here at Geneseo I would really like to put effort into getting better at proofreading my work for spelling and grammar mistakes. Being that I am an English Major I will be doing a lot of writing and often times I glance over silly mistakes and this distracts the reader from my main points. It can be difficult to remember all the rules and there will always be mistakes but if I can cut down on the amount of grammar mistakes, I make I feel that my writing would be much stronger and would convey a stronger message. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sarah Kenley ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing I focus on the overall structure of the essay to create an overall coherent essay. To an extent I am confident I am successful in conveying a structured essay with the use of a format, which my AP European History teacher strongly suggested to help with AP styled essays, which aided me in course work throughout the rest of my high school career. The simple outline starts with the introduction. In the introduction it is important to establish and make claim to what is being supported in the essay because this provides the background information needed to understand the topic, as well as 'grabbing' the attention of the reader. I therefore value finding evidence that supports the thesis of the essay, to create an overall sense of understanding in my writing. Within the essay the evidence supporting the thesis is found in the body paragraphs. My tenth grade AP European History teacher emphasized the importance of providing concrete evidence, which is supported by my own personal analysis of the provided evidence, explaining the relevance of the evidence to the given topic. When writing the body paragraphs, I consciously try to connect the topics of the paragraphs back to the thesis of the essay to ensure the readers understand my intentions and purpose in writing the essay. For example, in my twelfth grade English course I was assigned research paper on an influential poet. Before writing the essay I researched information on the poet, E.E Cummings, in order to support my thesis: "\...this poet introduced an innovative style of poetry..., going against the traditional poetic styles. He disobeyed these rules, playing with form and spacing, punctuation, capitalization... E.E Cummings expressed his emotions and character through his poetry, associating life events to the themes written in his poetry." Throughout the 14-page essay the information presented connected back to this thesis, through analysis of his poetry and his personal life in order to connect the two. Finishing the structured essay, a conclusion restates the themes outlined in the introduction, reminding the reader of the important points established in the essay. When writing essays, I tend to get too caught up in providing information I tend to put too much evidence, and write "word throw-up" on the paper. In the future to correct this issue I should organize my thoughts with a quick outline, reminding myself of the topic of the essay, preventing me from straying from the main point. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Madison Kennedy ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on providing at least three pieces of evidence that clearly represent the point I am trying to get across, and prove my point of view. By providing only one or two pieces of evidence, the reader will most likely not be convinced of my thesis, therefore not being interested in reading my essay at all. But, if I provide many reasons as to why my proposition is supportable, the reader will continue to read and put thought into my essay. I feel certain that I continuously validate my topics since in high school, my teacher was an amazing writer and on many papers she graded mine saying, "Great use of evidence!". My thesis in my eleventh grade english class was, "School uniforms should not be used for many reasons", and used this as evidence, "Uniforms can stop students from expressing how they feel through clothing and also may be too costly for many people who cannot afford it". Instead of using, "School uniforms are bad because they are not liked by students" , which is very broad and only states a couple of reasonings, I chose to write more in depth. I feel this skill is very important to essay writing, in an area which I am not perfect, but I try to put my best effort and knowledge in.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I plan on focusing more time and effort into my introduction and how to start my essays. I tend to not use any words to grab the reader\'s attention right away, and just state the obvious of what my claim is in the form of a summary. For me, this is nerve wracking since I do not want to turn the reader away from my essays, and believe I need to do more research and ask my peers for help on developing a more interesting introduction that grabs the reader towards my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Kenyon ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing, I focus on being as clear as possible. This helps to convey the message I am trying to get across in my writing. By writing clearly, it not only helps the *reader* to understand my writing, but it can also assist in *me* developing an even clearer understanding of my own points. This became the most evident to me when I started to get involved in reading academic works. I have been heavily reading namely philosophical works for over a year now and in that time period the books, essays, and authors that stand out to me the most are not the ones who are heavily reliant on jargon, completely unreadable and incomprehensible to the majority of people. Rather, it is those who clearly state their points that stand out in my memory. Take, for example, this quote from Deleuze, in *A Thousand Plateaus*; "Forming grammatically correct sentences is for the normal individual the prerequisite for any submission to social laws. No one is supposed to be ignorant of grammaticality; those who are belong in special institutions. The unity of language is fundamentally political." If you are wondering what he means by this, you are certainly not alone. Context provides no help in identifying his claim, in fact, the more you read the more obscure his point seems. I guess Deleuze was being literal when he proclaimed "Bring something incomprehensible into the world!". Reading Deleuze, and many other academics, made me realize the importance of having clarity as a skill in your arsenal. My 12^th^ grade creative writing teacher helped me to become familiar with practicing it. He helped me to transform large, unnecessarily confusing sentences like "the stone fulgurated with phosphorescence" into something more clear, like "the stone shimmered". In the future, I hope to further develop my voice in my writing; to add texture to what I write. There is a noticeable difference between the works of a novice and a work made by an expert. Although there are obvious technical differences between them, the most obvious difference is the voice that an experienced writer has. Perhaps as I continue to write, I can hone down on this skill and further develop a voice of my own. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: John Kersten ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I strive to command a powerful voice when writing. I enjoy the assertive, concrete nature of how my writing takes shape. I am able to clearly project the main topic I am dissecting and discussing through this assertive tone. When writers convey their ideas in a passive manner, ideas and information crucial to the writing piece can be easily swayed away from the true meaning of what the author is intending to convey. My former teachers were sure to ingrain this dominant way of writing in my everyday composition. The idea of an assertive, authoritative tone was more stressed by the educators teaching how to write DBQ documents in social studies classes. It is crucial when writing a DBQ to speak boldly and on the basis of true fact, and if you are citing an actual historical fact in an essay, you need to be self-assured that that information is true and adds value to your piece. When writing an DBQ essay on the American Civil War, I was able to clearly state my point and back up my argument that the northern and southern regions of the country were clearly divided on social issues by stating that most northern states had abolished slavery, while the southern states hadn\'t, after seeing a document that showed which states had anti-slavery laws. This conveyed that the north and south were socially, morally, and legally divided pervious to the war. I tried to apply this way of writing to my other courses as well, and this more direct way of writing makes communication between author and audience so much easier and concrete. Going forward, I would like to focus on the actual grammatical errors my writing often has. I would like to expand my knowledge on sentence structure and punctuation to create an even more clear experience for the audience I am preaching too, and heighten the level of communication and understanding between us. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: William Kilada ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [An area of writing I excel at is clearly stating my thesis and transitioning between different points and paragraphs. I strive to keep my thesis short and relevant to what the rest of the essay will be discussing. If the reader doesn\'t know what the point of the essay is or my perspective on the topic then they will be confused and not understand what the essay is conveying. That is why I also aim to compound my introduction and concluding statements as much as possible. My senior year advanced writing class helped me achieve this as well as transitioning smoothly throughout the essay. Learning more transition words and how to properly utilize them helped my writing greatly. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I think an area where I can improve on is adding more dialogue into my writing. I focused a lot on short stories in my twelfth grade creative writing class and in doing so I noticed a weakness in my ability to add meaningful dialogue into those stories. The fiction I invented often stayed with one character throughout and never explored other characters which would have diversified my stories. Even the dialogue I managed to create between two different characters was usually reiterating points I had already explained as the narrator. I\'d like to learn how to incorporate dialogue not only more effectively, but also include three or more characters in that dialogue. I enjoy concocting different types of characters into peculiar situations and believe adding dialogue to that would allow me to add more humor into my stories.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Introduction]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["The My Lai Massacre included two crucial elements that enabled the tragedy to occur.

I believe it is crucial to find the perfect place for every sentence, paragraph and quote in my writing. Without precise organization I am not able to effectively convey the message I am writing about. In the ninth grade I was in an honors english class in which I was expected to have exemplary writing, which included knowing how to accurately use organization skills. It was apparent to my teacher that I was not meeting these expectations so over the course of a few months I would work with her on rearranging my essays to more clearly relay my message. This work including rereading essays countless times to make sure they flowed in a proper manner as well as before even starting to write creating an outline of what I thought was a good way to organize the writing. An example of this would be that in my last essay I originally thought that the sentence "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Allowing law enforcement to have complete and total access to encrypted information could be a significant tool for keeping people safe." would be great final sentence for a paragraph. However as I continued writing it became apparent that it would work much better as the begginging sentence of another paragraph. Making this switch made the transition between two paragraphs much smoother and more comprehensive. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [During my journey through college I would like to better my skills in grammar and word choice. I am always looking to expand my vocabulary and I rely too often on using the same words while writing.

As someone who is already naturally long-winded in my day-to-day speech, I find that my writing also struggles to convey ideas in a more concise manner. Throughout my academic career, I have learned through many of my previous professors that instead of completely changing my writing style and the voice with which I write, I should employ the use of punctuation, such as commas and semicolons. Within my writing I heavily employ the use of commas in order to avoid long run-on sentences, break down my ideas into more digestible forms, and maintain the flow of information without losing my own voice in the process. By using commas and semicolons in place of simply breaking down my sentences with periods and making the piece sound "choppy", I am able to write at a higher level which still distinguishes myself and my work, but in a way that is neither overwhelming and confusing, nor dull and choppy. Even within this assignment on its own, my use of commas is prevalent. In the past I would start off with a complex idea such as: " The defunding of Planned Parenthood is not only an attack against women in the modern age, it is also an attack on minorities, those living in low income situations, and victims of sexual abuse, or abuse in general." The main message of the idea is understandable, but seems to be too much for one idea on its own. Through revisions, I would change the idea to a more concise argument: " The recent calls for defunding Planned Parenthood have made many women in the U.S. feel attacked on a personal level, feeling as if their choices and decisions are being regulated for nothing more than their sex. In truth, the attack of Planned Parenthood is a sign not only to women of their unequal status, but also to women of color, victims of sexual abuse, and those living in low-income situations." By adding in more commas and breaking apart the statement, I am able to display my views in a more comprehensive manner without seeming rushed or sloppy. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Throughout this course, I'd like to focus on improving the level of language I use in order to sound more academic. I would like not only to improve my language skills by increasing my vocabulary, but by learning how to rephrase ideas in order to sound better. I would also like to become better at integrating quotes or data from other works into my own writing without overusing them, as at times I lose my own thoughts in trying to demonstrate the thoughts of someone else. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} (468 words) ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nathan Klaits =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I'm currently focusing on elaborating on points that I make, rather than simply stating them and moving on. In the past I've received comments from teachers saying: "more please" or "elaborate here". Even though I knew what I was saying, I wasn't making it clear in my writing. Being clear about what my conclusion is is very important, because the reader doesn't have to guess at what is being said, and my thoughts are clearer. I started making growth in this area of writing in my senior year of high school. My AP Literature teacher had the class write a short essay every Friday during class. In the beginning of the year, I invariably got the "more please" feedback. When I went to her for help with revising my essays, she told me that every time I reached the end of a statement or point that I was making, I should add another sentence or two to make sure my point was clear. For example, instead of writing: "As this quote shows, the relationship between Hamlet and his father is central to the plot of the play." I should add: "Hamlet's deep love and admiration for his father is what drives him into depression in the first place and pushes him to seek revenge against his uncle." Going forward, I would like to further develop this technique where I start vague and gradually narrow in on my thoughts or the conclusion that I'm drawing. I still struggle with this at times, and often I don't realize when something is clear to me, but wouldn't be to a reader. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Della Knapp ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When revising, I try to focus on my use of active voice, as opposed to passive voice. I often find myself slipping into passive voice unintentionally, which slows down the narrative. Active voice is more engaging and keeps my pieces concise. I first learned about active voice during my freshman year of high school. My English teacher was known for being strict about passive voice, and once she taught us about it we were expected to always use active voice. My first few papers came back covered in red pen, but eventually I learned to watch for sentences to which you could add the words 'by someone'. This can be seen in an essay I wrote about ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[[Pride and Prejudice]{style="font-weight: 400;"}]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}[ by Jane Austen.

I have a habit of relying on commas for most of my sentences, however there are often better options.

In my junior year of high school my teacher taught us different ways to include transition words by giving us a worksheet that I later on learned to memorize that gave me different examples of words that can be used as well as telling me when they should be used. During the AOP summer program at SUNY Geneseo we had to write a research paper on any topic of our choice, an example from that paper from before i added a transition phrase would be "Advancements like the internet has rendered newspapers and magazines nearly obsolete. There are other technological advancements that have caused people to be replaced in the workplace." With the use of the transition word "in addition" the two ideas are connected changing the sentence into "Advancements like the internet has rendered newspapers and magazines nearly obsolete. In addition to the internet, there are other technological advancements that have caused people to be replaced in the workplace." A simple phrase before beginning an idea can change the entire structure of the sentence. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As time progresses I would be accustomed to new phrases and transition words that can be incorporated in my writing.

The one thing that I focus on when writing academic papers is qualifying the quotes I choose with my own insight. I believe this is essential in writing academic papers because the reader does not want to read an essay with only quotes from the books or research as they can do that themselves. They read the essay as a way to gain new insight into the particular work.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [For example, in my final essay in Humanities, I write, "Plato argues that "\...education is the craft concerned with doing this very thing, this turning around, and with how the soul can most easily and effectively be made to do it. It isn't the craft of putting sight into the soul. Education takes for granted that sight is there..." (190) Education, while incredibly important, does not equal sight and experience... Therefore, college is not the fairytale that is portrayed out to be. It is seen as a necessity, but in reality, it is a luxury and fantasy."

However, I am still faced with how to flow my sentences together without relying heavily on those. As can be noticed in this reflection, I rely a lot on the word "however" to move my sentences along.

I think this skill is important because it would be very difficult to communicate information if people weren't concise. It would take forever to understand the message and purpose of any information. When writing important emails, I always make sure to get my point across in a few short lines, without being too forward or rude. Ending an email with "I really appreciate any help you can offer" or "thank you for your time" are techniques I use to be respectful when asking something of someone. Rereading an email many times is another way I find a balance in my writing. For longer pieces, I try to implement the same thinking. In the twelfth grade, my English teacher constantly told us that the goal of writing is to get your point across in a clear manner. She taught us to make every sentence matter towards the purpose of your writing. One important tool I learned is when proofreading to reflect on every sentence and ask myself if it is introducing a new concept or repeating something else. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing I want to improve is my grammar and organization. I feel like as a writer I could organize and plan my essays better. I get caught up in developing one idea and seem to forget the rest. Transitioning is also difficult for me. I find that when I attempt to transition I end up just summarizing the previous paragraph without introducing the next. For grammar, I have always struggled throughout school and just used "what sounded best", which I know is a terrible tactic but admitting is the first step. Proper grammar usage and organization are important skills in the real world and will prepare me for better communication in whatever field I decide to work in. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ashlee Kuzemchak ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As I revise drafts or even begin to write a piece of work, I most often focus on clearly separated topics for each body paragraph. I find that I always emphasize different aspects of my argument in order to enrich the paper. I make sure not to have similar topics in different paragraphs, but to rather connect similar topics and evidence into one paragraph and then discuss a whole different side in another paragraph that still relates to my argument. If I feel I have strong evidence and strong thoughts that aren't repeated, I am confident in writing successfully. However, I was not always so aware. It wasn't until the senior year of high school in AP Literature class until I was told that my writing was too vague and my paragraphs too similar. I tended to repeat myself and not think of new ideas in each paragraph. I wrote my final essay on Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, telling how wisdom and time, which the Mariner had to his advantage, successfully changed and taught the wedding guest. My teacher was not all impressed, writing on an index card that I needed to stop repeating ideas and if I could not think of any different ones, I should haven chosen a different topic to write about. I realized he was correct when I found that I kept referencing one specific quote "for the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all" because my argument was not big enough to encompass multiple pieces of evidence or arguments in separate paragraphs.\ Areas of still needed improvement in my essays and works include topic sentences and transitions. I often find those aspects in my writing are choppy and ruin the flow of the paper. Structure is so important to make sure that the reader is not distracted or confused. Hopefully with improvement, my essays will be more coherent, strong, and sophisticated. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lauren LaBarge ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on making sure that my essays are organized into the correct order and structure. I do this so that I can clearly arrange my thoughts and make it easier for the reader to understand whatever point or claim I am making through my paper. I do this by introducing the topic in my introduction, then stating what the rest of my argument will look like through my thesis statement. I am fairly confident that this is a strength of mine because of my high school AP literature class. In this class, my teacher taught me how to create a thesis and then where to place it in the introduction. An example of a thesis statement that clearly maps out the rest of my essay would be "The role of the family in *Romeo & Juliet* is perhaps the most important, as the feuding families end up being the ultimate downfall for Romeo and Juliet. Were it not for the battle between the Capulets and Montagues, Romeo and Juliet could have had a totally different ending. Some important questions to address from the play may be in what ways are Romeo and Juliet driven to destruction by the wars of their families? Do the lovers underestimate the hatred between their fathers?". In the future, I think that my writing could use improvement when it comes to analyzing the text myself instead of simply summarizing it. I find myself falling into patterns of stating what happened in the story, but not really explaining why certain things are significant or what it actually means. I rely too much on what the author has to say than on my own ideas or thoughts. I believe I need to focus on this to become a better writer for the rest of my college career, and life in general.

If I use the same word repetitively, or words that are too general, my writing seems dull. A while back, my dad's girlfriend, who is an English Professor, suggested using a thesaurus to find synonyms for words. Using a thesaurus allows me to use more specific vocabulary while revising my writing. An example would be from my first paper this semester. In my rough draft I wrote, "Howley talks about the condition and its symptoms". After revising, and using a thesaurus I changed the sentence to, "Howley discusses the condition and its symptoms". This flows better and displays better vocabulary. As a second example to represent repeatable words in my writing, I am going to actively revise one of the words "better" from the previous sentence to "more appropriate". These words fit better and overall improve my writing. An area I would like to develop and acknowledge is in grammar and spelling. This is a crucial skill I constantly struggle with. In revising, I often have a trusted peer, as well as, send a copy to my dad's girlfriend to read over for mistakes. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Griffen LaBianca ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Writing to me begins often in the mental capacity. I often generally think of what it is I\'m going to write and what major points I\'m going to hit in my writing. This strategy often takes the form of me thinking about the writing for a long amount of time before writing out all of my text quickly, and then revisiting the text to edit and proofread, picking and choosing what I should and shouldn't say. One specific aspect of my writing is my heavy use of description and in-depth analysis in a something specific. A good example of this is in one of my assignments for my AP Literature course, I examined Bob Dylan\'s album \"The Basement Tapes\", taking an in-depth analysis of the diction and prose Dylan pieces together in his songs that make it seem more like a prosaic poem, rather than a song melody. \"Dylan focuses his stylized verbiage to paint a specific picture in the readers mind, songs like Odds and Ends, and Million Dollar Bash, offer not only a melodic tune that captures the listeners brain in a sort of cycle, the tune allows the listener to focus in on the loose interconnecting narrative Dylan unfolds.\" My writing often focuses too harshly on specific pieces of information, rather than connecting multiple larger concepts. But this also allows me to dig into deep metaphorical and thematic elements to the topic. \"Dylan specifically notates that \"burning fire\" to reference his experience in his motorcycle crash he experienced to portray to the listener the deeper agony of the piece.\" This specific deep insight is most likely a habit formed out of thinking of the main big ideas I\'m going to talk about in my piece before writing them all out. While it's been noted by my teachers before that this is, usually, a positive, and that it's good that I can find deeper then surface level details in the topics I\'m exploring, I\'d like my writing to be able to form more coherent connections in its major points and explain more general topics of subjects rather than intricate minor topics. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Taylor LaClair ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Taylor LaClair\ Dr. Paku\ INTD 106\ 5 September 2019\ \ In my writing throughout my academic career, one aspect I have always focused on is using an extensive vocabulary. The importance of having a wide vocabulary is that it keeps my audience interested in my writing, shows a higher intelligence, and helps me create points with greater precision. Throughout my lower education, such as middle and high school, I was always an avid reader and enjoyed reading books and novels that went beyond the comprehension a person of my age should have had. Reading these challenging books helped me to pick up new words that are better with describing things I want to write about. For instance, when I used to describe scenery or a setting in my writing, I would use words such as "old" or "new". Now I use different wording such as "ancient" or "contemporary". By switching old to ancient, I could show what I was writing about had a long history rather than just talking about old age. Deciding to use the word contemporary to replace new can show whatever I am choosing to describe is very up to date and modern and create more of an image in the audience's mind. Along with reading, there were several mentors who have helped me to challenge myself with my writing. In my junior and senior year of high school, I had to start writing more complex pieces for my classes and college essays. A well trusted academic aid at my high school, Mr. Fabry, helped me to improve my writing. He would set aside time to read my essays and to explain to me what wording would better reveal the point to the reader more efficiently than I had been.\ Areas in my writing that I need to make stronger is my sentence structures. Throughout my educational career I have always struggled with this. I often use run on sentences in my writing which can confuse the reader or bore them with what I am trying to get across. I need to better use commas to separate what I am saying or find a way to make the sentence into two. I'd like to begin concentrating on fixing this issue to better improve my writing in the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mikel LaCruise ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} During my academic career I have learned many different aspects of writing. As I got older, what I learned in English began to be more important information. Most recently I focused more on Essay writing than any other topic. Before taking the time to focus on essay writing, my writing had many issues. One of my biggest issues that I took the time to improve was transitions in writing. Before taking the time to work on my transitions my essays lacked a smooth flow to them. For example, in an Essay I wrote for my summer INTD course I said, "Before examining the dangers of vaping, you must understand the dangers of smoking as a whole." Before taking the time to evaluate my writing style, I had this sentence split into two different sentences. This made the flow of my essay less effective. After editing my essay with my mentor, as well as my teacher I was able to make my essay transitions better. One of the aspects of writing I want to further develop is my use of vocabulary. Often times while writing I find myself being repetitive. I want to further expand my vocabulary so that I can be able to use a wider range of words while writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sophie Laforest ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [A strength I perceive and strive for in my academic writing is "hooking" sentences. I'm not sure if that's a phrase used outside of my school, but it's goal is to capture the reader's attention and engaging them into the piece. I focus on this in particular because I find a lot of academic reading very dry. When I, personally, am engaged with a topic, I work at getting other people as invested in the piece, or topic, that I'm writing. After a lot of frustration of being bored with pieces, my 11th grade English teacher taught me how to convince people to read my essay by drawing them in with a "hook" and compel them to keep reading to find out why I said what I did or how it's true. My first essay I used this technique was a research paper on institutionalized slavery in the american prison systems. Originally, my introductory sentence was something like, "America has practiced unfair treatment towards minorities and the poor for a number of years", which is boring and obvious. After revision, it was, "Slavery in America is not over." Much more engaging and interesting! Who are the slaves? Isn't slavery illegal? How could I not know there's still slavery? It makes people wonder and helps me as the author drive facts to support the hard-hitting statement. "Hook" sentences at the beginning of a piece or paragraph help me focus on what I'm trying to prove or state in a more interesting way.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like to work on the strength of introductory and concluding paragraphs in pieces I don't feel particularly interested in. I have never been great at writing the parts of essays that don't convey much information. Intros and conclusions aren't the meaty part of an essay, therefore I can't prove something, which is a strong suit of mine. How do you convey information to introduce the essay but not give away what you're going to say? How do you conclude an essay without just summing up everything you just wrote? I know they can be pivotal, but the way I write them, they're hardly necessary and certainly not strong. Knowing what to say to keep readers engaged and stay true to my thesis is a struggle for me.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: John LaFountain ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing I prioritize structure and formatting of my argument and the examples following. Essentially asking myself does my argument make sense? Can the reader understand the points I am trying to convey? Does my English and the way I structure my argument \"make sense\" to average reader\"? These are several of numerous questions I ask myself during both the writing and revision process. After all, if the structure and wording of my writing is awry and difficult to comprehend the reader will fail to understand the argument I try to make. Therefore, if the reader fails to understand, I fail in persuading the reader of the \"truth and validity\" of my argument. Thus, the structure and formatting of my arguments and later evidence is of paramount importance. Both my parents and my past English (and History) teachers of primary education have contributed greatly, to my awareness of this writing skill in structure and formatting. In the eleventh grade I was given a simple format to provide a basis in argument structure and formatting. The format itself is as follows. Balanced sentence structure (longer and shorter sentences), one-two sentences long thesis in regard to the argument, and depending on the essay type one paragraphs devoted to a specific piece(s) of evidence. Later, citing the evidence as necessary. Then, following that with another paragraph devoted to a new piece of evidence for the argument outlined in the thesis and later citing said evidence, and so on. Afterwards, ending the argument with a conclusion. which in itself is simply the thesis restated with brief mentions of the evidence to corroborate.

In order to convey the theme better and provide a greater understanding overall, good examples or propositions are necessary to connect with readers. Without any examples, the audience can find it hard to imagine and discern what the author is trying to portray, making the writing appear without substance and consequently making it meaningless. My high school English teacher often encouraged me to add more depth to my work, and said that adding a clear and understandable example could extend the breadth of my writing. Readers use examples to help visualize the writer's point, while the writer uses them to flesh out and expand their theme. For example, in a recent summary I did for my anthropology class, I made sure to cover the author's use of the burqa as a symbol of the cultural divide between the west and Afghanistan, expanding upon their theme that we need to make an attempt to understand another's culture in order to find more peaceful options when we come into conflict. Another example would be the draft essay I did for INTD 105. In the essay, I gave an example of protecting the lives of soldiers as a reason to make code, and then used the Nazis as juxtaposition in favor of breaking code, allowing me to expand upon my theme of the complexities of ethics in regards to cryptography.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I'd like to work on getting my point across in a more concise way.

This helps me not only to stay organized in my writing, but it helps my audience understand the ideas I am attempting to convey. My former high school English teacher stressed the use of proper format in our papers, in regards to MLA, APA, and even the citation usage within those aspects. Beforehand, I would be lost as to where to start with my writing. This negatively affected my writing process, to the point where each of my papers came out to be an unorganized mess. Such a chaotic system impaired my ability to convene all my thoughts and ideas in my papers. A prime example of this can be seen in a previous work of mine from my junior year in high school, I wrote, "\...can be seen in the Anglo-Saxon epic, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Beowulf]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. Our hero, Beowulf, is seen facing a fearsome dragon all by himself, without help from anyone else," (Lallier). Here I used the word "our", a first person pronoun in an informal tone, which is unacceptable in formal writing. Another way this could be written is, "The warrior, Beowulf, is faced with the challenge to take down the terrifying dragon alone," which completely removed the informal tone by taking away the first person pronoun. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ In the past, I was usually against getting help with writing because of my own sheer stubbornness. However, there are many areas in writing that I definitely want to develop. I would like to focus on how I can thoroughly and accurately analyze the citations and sources in my papers. I would also like to break out of my shell a little more as a writer, to allow myself to have more creativity in my work. I believe that creative writing in a paper would help the piece flow more fluidly and smoothly. I consider writing as an escape for myself, especially when I am feeling too overwhelmed with my work.

In twelfth grade, my pre college writing teacher assigned us many persuasive essays in which our goal was to persuade the reader about something using supporting evidence. After writing many essays about all different topics it became easy for me to state my claim about a topic and strongly support it with research and evidence. Recently, I wrote an essay in my INTD writing class about cryptography where I stated my main point: cryptography is necessary in today's society. Then I went on to give evidence as to why it's necessary such as: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[it allows for privacy, secrecy, security, and identification while using the internet to access personal information and accounts.

This is the first sentence in your paper that gets the attention of the person that is reading the paper.

In the past when I\'m stuck, I have turned to my English teachers in the past for help and they have given me tips and advice on how I should approach writing my grabber sentence.

When I get my revised papers back they all end up having the same feedback which includes the teacher telling me to add more analysis. Using analysis after stating my evidence keeps the reader engaged and adds more information to go based off of what was presented in the thesis. Without analysis, certain types of writing wouldn't be engaging. As mentioned before the main thing my teachers would give me feedback about was my analysis. At the end of senior year, I had to write a term paper for my AP literature class which I thought would be difficult to do because I struggled with including analysis. I took my time writing my paper knowing that I had to include a lot of analysis and I used a template which was given to me by my teacher earlier in the year.

I find many times when I am writing, my thoughts come out mumbled without coherent sense, which is fine because that is the way I have been writing for as long as I can remember, but it is also one of the main reasons why I focus on the flow of words and ideas in my pieces. Back in middle school, my teachers would critic my writing saying I should practice outlining my paper and gather my thoughts down because my writing seemed to wander without purpose. Since then, whenever I am stuck while writing, I always reread from the beginning of my piece to see if the flow of words and grammar make sense. I also find writing my outlines helpful because I do not have to fidget remembering my ideas. I find rereading clears my mind and places my ideas back on track of what I want to say. When reading other pieces of writing from both published authors and my peers, I notice immediately whether the writer knows what they are talking about or not from the flow of their piece. The skill of explaining yourself through words is sometimes challenging for me in that I have moments where ideas rush to my head but I cannot sort them out quickly enough and then I lose the thought and so I have learnt, whenever I have an idea, I simply write everything and then edit. In my last writing from high school, I read it over and saw areas where I could have been more explicit. For instance, the assignment was to reflect on high school after completing four years. I spoke of a moment in high school everyone dreads: standardized tests. My piece briefly mentioned the topic and then I commented. Months later, I see I could have been more clear with introducing my chosen moment. For example, I could have explained the hours that go into preparing for these tests and the stress and fear of entering the testing room that make standardized tests the reason why I am glad to be parting ways with high school. ]{style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff; color: #2d3b45; font-family: 'Lato','Helvetica Neue',Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal;"}\ [Although in my future writing pieces I will still be focusing on the flow of my ideas, I am open to more criticism and comments on how to improve my work.

My eleventh grade English teacher made a template for peer editing which helped me understand how to be a good reader by identifying mistakes in my classmates' papers. There are steps to critique during peer editing that the template outlined such as underlining on rough drafts to let the writer know that there is something wrong in this sentence and you give a small recommendation on how to fix it. By learning from the mistakes and strengths of my classmates writing pieces through the peer editing template I am able to use editing as a way to improve on my own writing skills. Peer editing is the best way I get feedback as me and my peers are doing the same essay and we can help each other by editing grammar mistakes, structuring paragraphs, and adding feedback on rewriting parts of our essays that might not make sense. An example would be when I had a stale introduction in my writing piece for a history class on the police in twelfth grade, "The police are humans, they are humans who protect us, and they are those who often get neglected." By getting good peer advice I came up with an interesting introduction sentence "What do people think of when the word police is mentioned? The common answers that associate with the word police are drugs, guns, and crime." I acknowledge that being a good writer is to listen to the advice and criticisms given to me through peer editing as that would help me become a better writer. I would like to go forward in my writing by working more closely with my peers outside my class to do more peer editing as that allows for more time to critique and give helpful advice for each other. I will try to largely stay away from just giving praise and little feedback to the writer when I edit. Becoming a better writer is about improving upon what you did before by listening to feedback and recommending constructive feedback. There is always room for learning something new and improving on your writing and that's what I plan on continuing moving forward with every writing piece I create. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christopher Lemache ================================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Christopher Lemache]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I focus more on having body paragraphs like my introduction provided, to use one specific type of key terms.

I have noticed in other scholarly works I have read that the skills of drawing the reader in through an anecdote or hook has added to the overall readability and enjoyment I receive from their work, therefore I am inspired to use this practice in my own writing. It was during a historiography course with Dr. Samuels where time was spent honing in on skills and ideas on how to write as a historian that I began using this skill and attempting to sharpen it. An example of how I did this in my paper on the politics surrounding Shanghai in World War II is in the opening lines where I wrote, "In the Webster Merriam dictionary there are multiple definitions for the word resist. One defines resistance as exerting force in opposition, while another states resistance is to withstand the force or effect of something." I then apply these definitions to the political strategies of the Communist and Nationalist party in the War of Resistance.

I tend to try and elucidate my thoughts or arguments using the largest and most scholarly word I can possibly come up with at that time. I have heard from many that, while I have all the best intentions with this strategy, I tend to weaken my arguments by either misplacing or repeating words. After a careful examination, I can usually identify the portions of my work that have experienced this. For example, if I was writing a piece about my group research I conducted in Washington, D. C. last year about antibiotic resistance. An issue that could arise might look something like the following: "My group stressed the issue of removing antibiotics from livestock feed in our meeting with a member of Rep. Slaughter's staff. I also stressed the need for increased funding for this issue." In this situation, I not only used the word "stressed" in consecutive sentences, but I also could have used a word like "discussed," which would have more effectively made the point I intended. I have had discussions with both my educators in the past, as well as several peers who I hold in high regard, and all have advised me of this issue. The best tactic I have had assistance in developing is to read my paper aloud. This helps me to hear the inconsistencies or instances of overuse that may have occurred in the piece. Ever since I have adopted this as a regular practice, I have found that my work flows much better and no longer are the above issues prevalent. One area that I still need refinement in is accurately citing sources within my work. I always have concerns that I have not gone far enough in giving credit to the author or organization whose work I have quoted within my own. I am never sure which sections should have italics, quotes, parenthetical citations, and how to properly repeat this process if there needs to be more than one citation. Since I am now moving up the ladder of academia even further, I especially want to ensure that I have properly distributed credit where credit is needed. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Noah Lepsch ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Noah Lepsch ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ 9-10-19 Self-Reflection assignment INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ I would consider myself a very strong writer in the act of displaying imagery in my works of literature. Foremost, imagery is very effective in story writing. It is a very important fundamental skill that allows the audience to get involved in the literature and make use of their own imagination. Being able to paint a picture in someones head with nothing but words is remarkable. They say a picture is worth a thousand words but only a couple of words in a sentence is all it takes to form a picture in your head. Imagery helps the reader to visualize a movie in his/her mind. This can be mastered by simply inserting a few sensory words to a sentence. For example emerald is a better choice of color then green. I also find myself using imagery multiple times in the same sentence. For example Instead of saying "As I approached the base a man yelled at me." I would say "As I wandered my way to the dark and dreary fortress, I was scolded by a man dressed in camouflage." By changing only a few words, the story is already more intriguing to the reader and gets their mind involved.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ I started using imagery in 11th grade when my English 11 teacher was heavily focused on the U.S presidents. He would describe their life stories, backgrounds, what they did in office, and interesting facts about them. He would use descriptive terms because the majority of the presidents weren\'t around in time for the visual and audio recordings. Ever since then I realized how important the skill is to comprehending literature and I use it in my own writings. One example from one of my personal English Journals displays this perfectly. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*["As I disembarked that giant of a cruise ship for the last time things started to sink in.

A reader can understand what the author is trying to say through their tone, and even discover underlying meanings of the work. I focus on this skill by using basic conventions of writing such as commas and periods. The placement of one comma in a sentence can change the entire meaning and flow of a peice. I believe this helps me exhibit my own personal voice and helps amplify my passion for what I am writing. I made use of this writing technique in my college essay. I didn't truly find my voice and tone until I began writing this essay. I began it at the end of my junior year and my english teacher that year helped me develop this voice. For example, the opening line of my essay was "The greatest obstacle I have ever faced is my own fault. Nobody caused it, who knows if I even did. My anxiety is always there haunting me". After going over things with my teacher and re-reading out loud back to myself, the opening lines I ended up using were "The greatest obstacle I have ever faced and will continue to face until the day I die is of my own doing. No one else caused it, I don't think I even caused it. It was just there, anxiety, always there, haunting me every step I take."

It is vital to find evidence that corresponds with the subject, in order to back up the thesis. In addition, I also focus on critical analysis and development. Rather than just stating a random quote, and failing to elaborate, I try to find cohesive evidence, and put it into context. In my few years at Geneseo, I have learned the importance of finding relevant evidence, and creating an accurate analysis. This idea was introduced in my first Undergraduate English class and is evident in my most recent paper in which I discuss the African-American experience during the modern age in America. Major ideas of this paper include identity and racism, which are examined while reading Zora Neal Hurston's *How it Feels to be Colored Me.* I state, "During this time, Hurston begins to feel her identity decompose, stating, "I was not Zora of orange county any more, I was now a little colored girl" (Page 115). This shows that once Hurston was exposed to the true differences of race in the early 20th century, she no longer felt like an individual, but instead a generality which had no potential outside the color of her skin. This idea doesn't sit with Hurston for long though, and as she gets older she realizes the absurdity of physical identification believing that people are defined instead by what is "underneath" their skin." This quote is a great example used to examine Zora Neal Hurston's struggle with her race and identity, and helps to support the idea that African-Americans faced a great struggle both internally and externally, due to racial tensions in the United States. While revising, it is important to make sure that the evidence used, is relevant to the main idea of one's paper. Without these two vital things, the paper will be weak and inadequate. Although I have made sure to always check for relevance and development, there are other things that I fail to correct or improve on. While writing or editing a paper, I tend to focus more on the content rather than directing my attention to technical problems. Although I don't necessarily enjoy this tedious part of the process, it is crucial to have correct mechanics, and citations. Without these parts, the paper could lose it's comprehensiveness, or even it's credibility. As much as the content within the paper is important, it is vital to make sure that it is mechanically sound in order to ensure the reader's ability to understand. It is also crucial to use the proper format to give proper credit to an author of a text. In many cases, my editing process is rushed and technical errors are overlooked. Despite this, I hope to improve and develop my writing and editing techniques. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Miles Lieber ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [[One aspect of my writing that I specifically focus on is to develop a thesis statement, with context, ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[early in the]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[ paper.]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[ ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[Introductions are a very important piece to acquiring the reader's interest, and a lack of ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[relevant details can ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[quickly deter the reader]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[, however; keeping it concise is also important to maintain that interest]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[.]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[ A supported thesis means that ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[there are ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[details ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[introducing the topic as well as ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[a clear statement of ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[the opinion being presented. ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[This concept was presented to me when writing my final paper for my sports literature class ]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[in 12]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[th]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 data-fontsize="12"}]{.TextRun .SCXW82210762 .BCX0 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"}[[ grade.

I put a lot of emphasis on this focus because it is the foundation for any piece I am writing. To build a strong foundation is to write a solid piece. To do so, I revise frequently to condense the structure as much as possible. By condensing I mean writing sentences that only support after one another and leave out unnecessary pillars; a sentence from my old synthesis essay as an example:]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ \"The streamline of pictures enhances one's understanding and appeal to the subject to such an extent that it distorts and mutes audibly--- is clearly presented in the televised presidential debate where Kennedy won because of his image on television was more "crisp," the reason that his appearance was much more attractive even though their content was more or less the same provided by the radio.\"]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Revised - \"The streamline of pictures enhances one's understanding and appeal to a subject.

As an underclassman in high school I was focused more on meeting the requirements of the assignment to receive satisfactory marks than proving the point to the fullest and growing as a writer. Since, I have been focusing on utilizing clear, concise, educated vocabulary and while it is still expanding, it is something that I find myself improving upon with each draft. In my AP Literature class my senior year, I learned that writing is only judged on the important content of the paper, not the colloquialisms and extra words, or \"fluff\" as my teacher called it. I had to work on this especially in my college essay. Originally I had used all 650 words to detail my first cross country race, which did not prove that I was an all-around great candidate for colleges. I thus had to turn this \"fluff\" into meaningful content; how getting started in cross country led to growing as a leader and building a strong work ethic, and how this translated to other activities like Scouting and music. After many revisions, the words I used now told the story of my character with my first race as an example, rather than a story of my first race with my character as a minor detail. An elementary way I addressed this problem was ending my use of the word \"very,\" and instead if I wanted to express a greater level of whatever the following adjective was, using stronger diction to express that. While my teacher was very harsh at times and occasionally made me feel as if everything I wrote would be inherently bad, she definitely helped me prepare to be a college writer. As a college student I hope to learn from both INTD 105 and INTD 106 how to employ effective writing strategies in order to prove my point in an effective, educated manner. This requires learning with an open mind. I want to learn to naturally use the templates taught in \"They Say/I Say\" so that I sound well-informed and get my points across in a way that leads them to believe that I am correct, despite any preconceived notions they may have. I can do this through taking INTD 105 and putting in the effort to keep up and striving for a high grade.

In the early stages of my senior year of high school, I became unhappy with my academic performance in my english class, due to low grades on my writing assignments. I began to look into my papers, and noticed a lot of points missing on the grammar section of the rubric consistently throughout my first few papers. As well as noticing this problem myself, my 12th grade teacher also noticed as well and suggested I slow down with my writing telling me it\'s generally good in most areas, but stressing the fact that I make small mistakes in grammar frequently that were significantly impacting my grade. On one of my earlier essays throughout the year, an essay on William Shakespeare\'s book \"Othello\", my teacher included several suggestion on my paper after being submitted, most saying \"add the word the\", or \"a comma is needed here\". These were all the result of not double checking my work very well , and moving too quickly through my work. After my realization here, I began to make this my priority while writing, and revising, and quickly began to see a great increase in my performance in the class. I have continued to make that my main focus while writing, and it has since helped me be a much better writer, with better grades as well. However, there is still areas of struggle with my writing, that need improvement. One that sticks out more so then the others is my ability to use direct sources and quotes to further strengthen my argument. I tend to focus more on my own argument, and less providing actual facts, which in exchange, overall makes my argument less credible. Throughout this course I plan on making sure I have a sufficient amount of outside information from experts and professionals, to overall perform better on my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Qiwei Li ====================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus most on making the key terms of the introduction precise because it could help me to establish strong thesis in the introduction.

I\'m strong confident I could use the template come from my high school English teacher and put into my article. It helps me to notice the importance of key terms and made clear introduction. Also encourages me how to grasp the key terms and let the reader understand my thoughts. For example,"people had victory in WW2." I wrote this vague thought in the beginning and with out any details.

My tenth grade english teacher would tell me to specifically look to cut down the amount of words in one sentence, or two create two sentences of the one sentence. Therefore when I revise my initial draft, I always read carefully to make sure that my sentences do not sound very complicated and run along with more words than are necessary. For example, in my last writing assignment, which was a paper written about traditional east asian history and how I would form my government in that certain time period, I wrote "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Thanks, to both of these, the Song Dynasty had 46 countries trading with them, and that would be one of the goals of my government.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[" This could have been written better as, My government would reflect the trading system implemented in the Song Dynasty, which had 46 countries trading with them.

The tutor explained to me that without addressing the other side to my argument my writing loses validity. Being able to identify the opposing argument of mine grants me the freedom and validity to fully dive into my discussion. Addressing the opposite side to a debate will start a constructive conversation between the two parties in which they can learn from each other to reach a collaborative opinion on the matter at hand. For example, when writing a final paper on the death penalty, I introduced my writing by starting off following the template exactly and say \"The texas legislature says that the death penalty is ok, I say that the death penalty is not ok.\" Filling in the blanks of the template gave me a chance to revise and expand on my point and make it sound a little more scholarly. My revision read like this \"The texas justice system believes that the death penalty is a just punishment for murder, records say that the shortest time an inmate has spent on death row was 252 days. Keeping someone in solitary confinement with their only escape being strapped to a metal chair and electrocuted may be breaking the Eighth amendment.

Every English teacher that has read my writing has said I need to work on being less vague and include more details, which I try to focus on when I am revising my work. This skill is important because it helps make the thesis of the paper more clear and helps the reader understand better. I would love to be able to expand on the length of my writing and the conviction I use when writing argumentative papers. Being able to write longer papers would be helpful when I have to write longer essays and it will make shorter essays seem easier. My AP Literature and AP Language and Composition teachers were so important in helping me become a better writer in regards to adding detail and length to my essays. In my final AP Literature paper I said "Notions of economic superiority transcend across cultures, causing profound decreases in sense of self-worth, however, the projection by the "superior" may act as a motivational force, driving people to rise from the bottom in order to end the torment", I then moved on to explain in more depth. This is a stark comparison to an essay I wrote at the beginning of senior year where I said "The essay "The Ugly Tourist" by Jamaica Kincaid, was very interesting and made many valid points I had never thought of", and didn't expand much after that, I just used lots of "fluff" to make the essay longer.

This is important because it makes sure that the reader has a clear, easy-to-follow outline showing where the essay is going. Papers and essays are easier to read if the paragraphs flow together well. During my junior year of high school, my teacher made sure to spend extra time focusing on teaching us how to do a proper outline for an essay. The model they provided is the one I still use today. This outline prompts me to select the main topic for each paragraph, and to write down a few ways to interconnect the paragraph topics back to the main concept before even sitting down to write the paper. This is an easy tool I can use to make my thoughts clearer and more organized. An example of this would be, on the very broad topic of finances, picking a smaller subcategory such as "Financial Wage Gap Between Men in Women in the United States." Following the outline model I was provided with in high school, the first paragraph would give an explanation as to what a wage gap is. Essay-filler paragraphs could focus on the history of the wage gap, how race impacts wage gap, and how profession impacts wage gap. The last paragraph is used to reiterate the key statements made in each of the prior paragraphs. Moving forward in my writing, I would like to spend more time focusing on going in-depth with my concept choices. I feel that, when given the option, I tend to go for essays with broader subjects. This leads to higher potential for disarray. To help myself with this goal, I could use a sociological-minded approach and narrow the topic down to the most explanatory concept possible (i.e. for the idea mentioned above, I could start with the idea of finances, decide to focus on the wage gap between men and women, then make it specifically about the U.S., and possibly compare it through the decades). Discussing ideas with my teacher before beginning my essay could also be a great resource. This way, I can narrow down my focus and give it the proper in-depth explanation that both it and the reader deserve. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexia Lopes ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Alexia Lopes]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [9-3-19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Assignment \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [A skill over the years that I have been working on when it comes to my writing is not only clearly stating a thesis but connecting every idea I have back to the thesis and explaining how it relates. This is a very important skill and I feel like different teachers in my high school career have helped me to improve upon this skill. I feel like when students write an essay, we tend to focus on establishing a strong thesis and forget to explain how it relates to every example and thought that comes up. For example, in an essay that I wrote about the novel ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[On such a Full Sea]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ by Chang-Rae Lee for my AP literature class in high school, my thesis stated "Lee describes how a utopian society demands authoritarian rule and a command-control economy while humans natural born desire is for individual freedom and choice. Therefore, the different preferences lead to inequality within society". Now that I had clearly stated my thesis, every body paragraph had to relate back to it in some way. "Chasing perfection is what leads to corruption, and ultimately failure. Through Uncle Kellen, Lee reveals why a society like B-mor brings a community farther apart instead of closer together through the blindness of B-mors population". Without restating my thesis, I was able so summarize the central idea of a specific body paragraph that related to my thesis but wasn't the exact same thing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I feel like an area that I could do better in is my ability to free write more often. As students, we tend to be obsessed with using fancy vocabulary and making no grammatical mistakes, I am no exception.

This skill is so important to me because I personally think it is the fundamentals of writing. If I can't attain effective communication, I think I wouldn't be able to convey my voice. I find when I read a classmates work and they misspell a word or a sentence doesn't make sense, my attention span diminishes. I always have someone proofread my essays before I turn in my assignments even after I revise and check them myself. Someone I always look up to for writing advice is a family friend, Mr. Colson, he is a former lawyer and is an amazing speaker and writer. For example, my first draft of my college essay was a mess. I revived many sentences, rearranged words and read it over and over again until it was perfect, figuring it was most important essay I have written thus far in my writing career: "Now, when I check the time or reach to answer a text, I am facing the reality - the irony.

I place a lot of value in the fluidity of an essay, so when I'm writing an academic essay I attempt to make sure it flows well, each thought segueing into another. For example, in the most recent essay I did, I made sure to group each aspect of my analysis (comparison, word choice, etc.) into separate paragraphs, and then made sure the closing sentences of each paragraph subtly introduced the next thought I was going on to, as well as made the reader understand how the paragraphs related to each other. A good example of this is in an essay I wrote about Anthony Burgess' most popular novel, *A Clockwork Orange---*specifically, about why American publishers omitted the final chapter of the novel when it came to the US*.* At the end of a paragraph discussing the main character Alex's eventual growth, I introduced the idea that this might have been why Americans didn't like the last chapter of the novel. I then followed through with that idea in the next paragraph: "Although America stood for freedom, the last chapter preached subversive content and the justification of acts that are typically unforgivable, and American publishers felt that keeping the last chapter in the book would have been too problematic for the country." I primarily learned how to develop this part of my writing from my AP Language class in high school. The teacher, Mrs. Dean, would encourage students to come and talk to her, as well as suggest multiple revisions of their work. Through trial, error, and critique, I was able to better understand and use this writing skill. One aspect of my writing I feel I could develop more is focusing on the analysis of a body of work instead of simply summarizing plot or characters. I've received feedback on earlier essays that states I started out with a good point, but after a while I began automatically falling back onto those summaries, which weakened my entire analytical argument. In INTD 106 this semester, I would like to stop myself from doing that, and learn more about how to write a cohesive analytical argument. I believe this could help me with non-analytical academic essays, as well, which will be very useful as I continue with my English major. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jason LoVullo =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on how to create a better hook to intrigue my readers into listening what I have to say. If my hook isn't entertaining, then the reader won't be intrigued and won't internalize the actual material. I have been trying to better this skill by following a template I was given in eleventh grade by my English teacher. The template shows me ways to include the different ways to make my topic more exciting and entice the readers. My English teachers have always helped me better my hooks and helped intrigue my readers. An example of this is in my informational research paper when my original thesis was "in this paper I will be explaining the history of the Pittsburgh Pirate's professional baseball team". Using this template, I changed that into "let me take you on a journey into the history of one greatest baseball franchises in the history of the league". The hooks have enabled me to get my point explained better and allowed for me to entertain the readers. Going forward I want to feel I need to work on expanding and explaining my ideas. I have much trouble with getting my point across many times and I need to work on expanding my original thoughts. I am able to get the original idea across, but the explaining aspect is the large struggle for me. I need maybe a better template or some ways I can work on how to explain my ideas. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: A\'lee-shah Lubin =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Lubin 1 A'lee-shah Lubin Dr. Paku INTD 106 3 September 2019 Self-Reflection \#1 As I revise my drafts for academic work, I focus on the purpose of my piece. This is essential to do because knowing the purpose helps organize and prioritize information in a coherent manner. Without knowing the purpose of a writing assignment, it is impossible to truly complete it. The importance of purpose was instilled in me early on by many of my English teachers. As my audience reads through my work, I convey whether I will inform them, persuade them, explain something to them or entertain them. This is evident in many of my writings throughout my high school experience. In one of my assignments from my 11th grade English class, I was given the task to write an argumentative essay on the Oedipus Complex. I ended my introduction with, "In my opinion I think that the Oedipus Complex should not be taken serious and experts in the field of psychology have no reason of exploring ways to help those who have it because it is just an imaginary thing." I was straightforward and immediately let my teacher know that I would try to persuade them that the Oedipus Complex was a hoax. In another one of my assignments, I start off by writing, "Research.omicsgroup.com provides a list of the estimated amounts of deaths from different genocides. The numbers range from 2,000 to 11,000,000 deaths either directly or indirectly caused by genocide." By initialing my essay with data, it lets my readers know that I would inform them about genocide and its harshness on society. As I further my education at Geneseo and overall my career, I would like to focus on making my writing more complex. I tend to use common [everyday]{style=";"} spoken language when I write, knowing that I should use higher-level vocabulary. I strive to learn how to control the complexity of my vocabulary so that my readers will have a better understanding of what I am talking about. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Logan Lum ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Self-Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Logan Lum]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 105]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [8/31/2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [Throughout my years writing papers, I focused on taking out unnecessary or redundant words and phrases, then replacing them with more concise, detailed statements. I do this to get to the point faster and give the clearest explanation or image possible. This technique is important because it elevates my writing to a more professional and intellectual level. The person who influenced me most with this method of reflective writing was my mother. She was an elementary and middle school teacher and always would remind me to revise my writings and condense what I was trying to write in the most effective way possible. An example of how I would condense a wordy sentence like "A way to promote academic growth in children who come from low income families and have low grades would be to increase the bond between the connection between teachers and students." would be to focus on the main idea, improving the grades of children in low income families, and then elaborate or specify why or how to do this. A revision of the previous sentence would look like this, "A way to promote academic growth in children who come from low income families would be to increase the bond between teachers and students."

For me, using metacognition allows me to clearly explain my claim or state something without straying from the main topic of my writing. I believe the use of metacognition is important in writing because it allows the writer to make their piece unique. By using metacognition you can explain your statement when refuting, supporting, or justifying another author\'s claim that you have integrated into your own writing. When doing this I typically follow the guidelines I was given by my eleventh grade english teacher. She explained that the use of metacognition should not be the main technique I use when writing but, rather a supplementary tool to use when needing to further explain why I chose to say something or use a specific piece of evidence. One example would be my further explanation of a statement like "Even though I am the baby of my family I consider myself to be the most independent out of all of my siblings" Then adding the statement " I have a hard time asking for help because I\'m accustomed to doing everything myself, which is why I consider myself independent." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An area I hope to improve upon in writing would be the transition and integration of quotes from outside sources.

This is because they usually strengthen an argument which might not be very strong without the use of quotes. Usually, in my writing assignments I have a combination of quotes and my own writing and when revising my papers, I pay close attention to the quotes that I have selected to make sure that they are relevant in some way to the topic and my argument. Although I implement quotes into my essays, I rely on them too much and fail to describe them effectively. In other words, I use a quote in an essay without explaining why i\'m using it or relate it back to my argument effectively. Often, when writing a research paper or another piece of writing where quotes would be used, I would select a quotation that is very long and not fully relevant to my argument. For example, I had to write a paper for my english final and I used a quote that was extremely relevant to my argument but it was too long and, because of that, I was unable to analyze it fully. The quote, which comes from Ann Patchett\'s novel, [State of Wonder]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}, was \"The question is whether or not you choose to disturb the world around you, or if you choose to let it go on as if you had never arrived\...If you pay any attention at all you\'ll realize that you could never convert them to your way of life anyway\...The point, then, is to observe the life they themselves have put in place and learn from it.\" [The quotes that I would select would be too long and only parts of it would be beneficial in my argument. I struggle with selecting the most important aspects of a quote.

Throughout all of my previous essays I have always made sure to find strong and relevant quotes and new ways to introduce them. Using different combinations such as "they state" or "according to them" keeps the essay fresh and the reader engaged. An example from previous writing comes from an essay written about paying college athletes. When I brought in my first piece of evidence I stated, "Hausfeld Proclaims, "Athletes have rights: they have rights to a fair allocation of revenue, to health care, to career development." I have received positive feedback from my previous teachers about the types of quotes I use and how it impacts my essay.

Having a strong thesis statement would allow all other aspects of my essay to improve. I would also love to work on the organization of my writing.

For example I would write about epilepsy, and I would say, "Epilepsy can make things very difficult, it limits you, and sometimes you may feel embarrassed about it." I would put them in this order in order to make sure I cover each topic in detail, and in that specific order. I would put them in this order so when I am ready to write the middle paragraphs I can make sure they flow easily. I didn't use this technique until high school when I was taught this technique, and it helped me structure my papers better than I ever did in the past.

I find myself often using the same words too much so sometimes I will try to switch up the words I'm using, or I will change the structure of the sentence completely to add even more variety to my paper. It is important to use proper grammar to make writing easier to understand, and it is important to use different words to keep the writing interesting and keep the reader intrigued. Using the same word(s) too many times becomes repetitive and boring. My 12^th^ grade English teacher helped me with my writing a lot. He taught me little tricks about grammar and he also helped me often find new, more appropriate and interesting words to spice up my writing. I have also utilized different computer programs such as Microsoft Word and Grammarly to help correct my grammar. In review of an old essay, I found that I used the word "very" before an adjective to describe a lot of things. So instead of using "very" every time, I went back through my essay and changed the words up. I used "extremely", "ridiculously", "incredibly", "greatly" and words of that nature to get my point across. This made my writing a bit more interesting and not so repetitive. In the future here at Geneseo, I would very much like to improve the vocabulary I use when writing. I sometimes feel as though I could use more sophisticated words and better sentence structure within my writing to improve it overall. I think my writing could be greatly improved with just a few changes, and vocabulary is something I would like to work on.

What I mean is to always make sure you explain the reason behind using any piece of evidence that is going to enhance your argument. No matter how a piece of evidence may register in the reader's mind it must be backed by the writer's thoughts and analysis of that certain evidence. If not done it can leave the reader unsure of what position I take on the subject. This became something I am very conscious of last year when I took ENGL 203 Reader and Text: Marginal spaces. Professor Woidat would preach the notion to our class all the time when discussing and revising essays in class. It was something I did not realize was missing from the essays I was writing until I started looking for it. It is a great skill to have and one that every writer needs especially in writing persuasive essays. There are ways to develop the skill even further than acknowledging the evidence that you are using. It relies heavily on knowing when to use a certain piece of evidence and being able to properly use it in a way that doesn't just state a fact. Last year in my U.S foreign policy class I had to write a 10 page research/persuasive essay for my final paper on why I thought there should be no wall built between the United States and Mexico. In using my evidence I could not just write "the wall will cost hundreds of millions of dollars." without explanation to back that up, I do not have an argument at all. The evidence has to connect to a bigger picture; in this case I would say "the wall is an unnecessary expense that we do not need and will not stop illegal immigration in the long run." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One way I can develop this skill is to constantly think of my essay as a whole rather than that specific paragraph or piece of evidence.

So that the reader can clearly see when I am moving on to a new topic, comparing two subjects, or perhaps referencing a central idea I had previously stated. Whenever I go back to revise my work, I usually tend to hone in on the endings of my paragraphs to try and improve the fluidity of it. I recall this process taking place for my college essay. My English teacher was assisting me with the revisions. In my essay, I went into detail on how the mission trips I volunteered on had an impact on me, and changed me as a person. I started the paper fairly vague, stating how helping others can ultimately be more beneficial to ourselves. Then I attempted to recall the various events that I took part in to aid others, such as helping troubled children see what's important in life, building an elderly couple a patio, or painting a school. I was able to clearly throw my ideas on paper, yet it didn't seem right. So my teacher aided me with not only connecting the various stories together, but also how to connect my experiences back to the major theme; for that was the whole point of the essay. After seeing it done before me, I recognize that I am capable of these connections, but I still struggle with them. One skill that I hope to achieve at Geneseo is to be able to formulate all my ideas onto the page. Whenever I sit down to write a paper, all of these different ideas and strategies rush into my head.

A similar statement was used; "If the sexual assault occurred prior to the age of 16 years old, compared to being 16 years or older, the odds of attempting suicide will be 3 to 4 times greater when the first reported sexual assault happened".

So, it is no surprise that I now focus on establishing a strong relationship with the audience in my writing. I believe that through tone, I can make my audience listen to me, even if they do not agree whole-heartedly with what I am saying. However, I didn't always understand how powerful an author's voice could be. It wasn't until I asked my twelfth grade English teacher, Mrs. West, to sit down with me to edit my college essay, did I realize how impacted an audience can be by an author's words. My essay was deeply personal, yet, as we were reading it over for the first time, I couldn't help but realize how repetitive and passive it sounded out loud. I set most of my essay in the past and jumped from my early childhood to my highschool days. That being said, it was difficult for me to establish a time setting without sounding jumpy. My teacher helped me transform the passages of my youth into a story only I could narrate. Instead of just telling my audience that I was at one time a little girl who liked the land of make believe, they were with me, as "I climbed into my mother's worn black leather heels and pos\[ed\] in front of the mirror." (Manning, Hannarose, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Stepping into Their Shoes]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[).

I truly believe that it made me a better writer. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I look out towards the future, I would like to learn how to write consciously. Since starting at Geneseo a mere two weeks ago, many professors have been drilling into my head the importance of saying something with a lot of substance in fewer words.

I find this beneficial because it helps to strengthen my argument or the point I am trying to get across while adding more ethos. When adding a counterclaim into my writing it allows the reader to see more than one point of view. Throughout high school my teachers have made it evident that this skill leads to a stronger piece of writing. It allows the reader to stay engaged because they aren't reading about solely one opinion. After stating a counterclaim I tend to immediately refute it with my own claim. When refuting the counterclaim I make sure that my side of the argument is stronger, which is done by adding more detail. My intentions by doing this is to hopefully convince the reader or audience that my side of the argument is the better side of the argument. An example would include an argumentative essay that I wrote this past year in high school. The topic of this essay was based on whether or not phones should be allowed in a high school classroom setting. In this essay, I argued that phones should be allowed but the use should be limited. First I had to add my counterclaim. I started the essay by saying "Some argue that phones should not be allowed at all in a classroom setting because they can become a distraction and take away from the students learning environment". After explaining this, I went onto refute it and say "This does not compare the reasons why phones should be allowed but limited. For example, they can allow the class to play different educational games and search for outside information if they need it for a specific assignment or project". For each of my following reasons, I would make sure to start with a counterclaim to strengthen my writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going further with my writing I would like to focus on eliminating the amount of passive language I use. Instead of having all of my work be passive I would like to better myself at writing using active language. This was a key aspect that my past teachers focused on consistently. Constantly saying how passive language can drag on and be unnecessary in most cases. I have always struggled with finding a different way to portray my ideas without the use of passive language and really hope I am able to better that skill this year.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sara Marcano ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing, my most conscience goal is to create insightful ideas that support my thesis. Making connections in my writing deepens my personal understanding of my own thoughts and my readers comprehension as well. It also creates a more sophisticated thought process and essay for my readers. AP Literature greatly helped me become comfortable forming complex ideas through classical novels. In this class I learned to ask questions and find deeper meanings, acquiring the ability to recognize perspectives deeper than face value. This largely helped me feel more connected and confident in my writings. When reading the novel, *The Road,* by Cormac McCarthy, the idea of "human connection" is crucial to best understand the sacrifices characters made in a desiccated and apocalyptic world they were forced to live in. Humanity can be lost in intense situations such as an apocalypse which stripes individuals of their abilities to show compassion towards others. If I hadn't learned the importance and purpose of "deeper meanings" I would have never been able to comprehend the complex meanings of any novel and its messages. An area I continue to struggle with is organization with my thoughts and writing. I tend to have the right ideas however I lack the ability to separate my information in the best way that will most efficiently represent my writing. Organization of writing is extremely important to hit necessary points that strengthen an idea. Without organization a great essay can be overshadowed by confusing and distracting writing. In the future I plan to brainstorm my topic and ideas and separate them into an organizer. This will organize my ideas correctly and help me write a properly written essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christian Marcello ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I purley focus on making sure my conclusion wraps up the important points correctly and efficiently. I do not only bring up the points that I made throughout the essay but also include new ending points to conclude the essay the right way. I've learned that only touching upon the arguments and key details in your essay will make your concluding sentences well-rounded. In 9th grade, my english teacher noted a key formula to generate a great guide to follow. Not only for the conclusion but also the essay in general. I believe I was taught the right mold to focus in on the most important sentence structures and points in my concluding paragraph. An example for a general concluding sentence would be "There are multiple athletes that should be paid because they make money for their respective colleges". Instead the formula presented would be "As most of the information provided all of the alumni college athletes make over 500,000\$ when they went pro, but still believe they needed to be paid for the revenue they brought into their school." This is a good example that I can use down the road. As I continue my writing career, throughout college and for the rest of my life I want to keep developing my skills. I believe I put too much emphasis on the points I have already made in my body and not the other points that close up the text the right way. The conclusion needs to be more of a thought that keeps the reader wondering at the end and not a summary of the multiple arguments I brought up.

I believe I can do this because when I was a junior in high school my English teacher and I met after school a couple of times and went over strategies to help me make my essays easier to read and meet the length requirements. One technique she helped me with was for me to write the essay do not read it for a day and then reread the essay. This has helped me a lot because not when I reread an essay I can find ways to make it longer but cutting out words like it, them, they, and replace those words with what they actually represent, which also makes the essay clearer and easier to read.

This is something I have found myself to focus on the most when writing. This skill is especially important to me when writing because it allows the reader to easily pick up on the main points I am trying to get across in my writing. The claims that follow the thesis statement are just as important if not more when writing. Claims are what help prove your thesis, and if your claims don't support your thesis then the reader could get lost in the information being given rather than focusing on the thesis. For my junior thesis I was trying to come up with claims to support without getting off topic. I started expressing my opinion rather than sticking to factual evidence. I order to correct this mistake I eliminated my views about the topic and focused on what I could prove using evidence from articles I found online. Therefore, it is important to create a secure thesis that can be supported by well-built claims. When writing I often struggle with expanding my vocabulary. This is because I sometimes have a hard time figuring out how to word sentences in a manner that flows with the writing the best. My teachers have explained this issue to me and have tried to help by giving me different ideas for my writing. I believe that expanding my vocabulary is important to my writing skill because it allows explain my topic without using such wordy sentences.

Most of the papers that I had written in high school were about argumentation and supporting your opinions with strong backup statements. My teacher told me that I change the topics too abruptly, I have trouble transitioning my ideas and statements to new ones. I believe that I use outlines too rigidly and don't focus on "flow." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An example of this can be seen in my college essay, " I would like to think that my birth parents placed me for adoption, not because I am a female? And if they did place me for adoption because of my gender, I wonder if they had more children." I then transition to "Growing up as an adoptee has changed my life. It plays a large role in what I think I would like to study. I would like to major in biology, specifically genetics. Not knowing my genetic makeup is something that has always been a lasting question." While this is a college essay and there were limitations, I think the transition is too abrupt from talking about something personal and stating facts about the Chinese government to move on to my area of study. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would like to work on making my writing flow and I want it to have an impact on my readers.

It is incredibly important to look beyond the text to find out what the author truly means behind their words. I often struggled with that and only looked at things superficially, not really understanding the hidden meanings left by authors. I improved greatly with help from my high school english teachers but it is easy to still make mistakes while reading works written by authors who use hidden meanings and analogies. One of the key things to look for while revising is whether or not what I am writing is all making sense together and if what I\'m writing is actually what the author was implying in their work. In an essay I wrote in twelfth grade, I had been writing about the meaning of a quote from the play "Hamlet," by William Shakespeare, but my meaning did not make much sense when compared with the meaning of the work as a whole. I had to work through the words of Shakespeare in order to understand what the characters were saying and to figure out what it actually meant. Once I worked towards that, it pushed me to see the significance of looking past my immediate reactions and to dig deeper into the work. This is necessary for writing an essay that will get the point across correctly. It is also what will help the audience clearly view any evidence present to support the argument. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing that would greatly help my writing is to develop a more advanced vocabulary. This would really bring my writing up to another level. I fear that using too many advanced vocabulary words will make my essays look like I tried too hard and don't understand it, but starting off with a few that I do understand how to use should not be too hard. In the past, whenever I have used certain words that I consider above my usual vocabulary range, I second guess if I am using them correctly. Even if I had been using them correctly, I had sometimes replaced them for words I'm more comfortable with, which took away my opportunity to expand my writing vocabulary.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jessica Mattioli ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [While writing, I focus on organization and structure. In order for a piece to be organized, there are many aspects that need to be accounted for. For example, simply stating an idea in a sentence or two, and then immediately analyzing that idea, more detailed and more in depth. Depending on the type of writing piece that I am doing, I will usually separate each idea in it's own section. This makes the writing flow smoothly and clearly, which makes it easy for the reader to understand. I learned this technique in my english classes, social studies classes, and my theory of knowledge class in high school. This technique was especially enforced by my theory of knowledge teacher and IB advisor during my junior year and senior year, Mr. Ackroyd. Each time we had to write an essay, he would create a planner with this outline. By following this structure, it allows for my ideas to be presented clearly and understood. For example, my senior year of high school I was required to write an extended essay for the IB diploma. I decided to do my essay on the topic of world studies, with the subject being the Catalan independence movement. I separated my essay in sections: history of Catalonia, reasons for the independence movement, different movements taken for independence, and reasons for anti-independence. I used those as subtitles throughout the essay to separate my thoughts, and within those subtitles I provided detailed evidence. For example, in the subtitle labeled "Reasons for Independence" I described how the Catalans consider themselves unique from Spain, how they have to pay taxes that other regions in Spain are not required to do, how they have their own government, etc. I feel that this technique organizes the work in a clear and effective manner that makes it easy for the reader to understand.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Something that I would like to focus on in my writing is making my points concise and nonrepetitive. For example, sometimes I feel that my points within my writing can be repetitive, but worded differently. This is especially true if there is a word count requirement. I can work on this by planning my writing, or making an outline. Having an efficient amount of examples and evidence will prevent repeats.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(379 words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Marissa Maxwell ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I write, I focus most on grammar and prioritizing the structure of my work. To me, the most important aspect of my essays is making sure I use the proper conjunctions at the correct time. My goal is to make the flow of the essay structurally appealing to the reader, through the proper use of syntax. By doing this, I am easing in the readers comprehension of my paper. For example, some people might write a sentence like " your taking this class?" However, with proper grammar, it would look more like "you're taking this class?" Many people have a difficult time distinguishing between the proper your's, to's, and theirs. This leads to widespread misinterpretation. Prior to my knowledge of the differences in specific conjunctions, I'll be the first to admit that my writing was a whirlwind of improper grammar, and therefore quite difficult to understand. When I got to about 7th grade, my english teachers made it a point to teach me when to use which form of the word that I was looking for. Since then, I have become hyper aware of all my writing and the possible misinterpretations that the misuse of a word might cause. Personally, I love acquiring new skills to improve my writing. There is always room for improvement, no matter how experienced of a writer you are, and that is one of the major things I adore about education. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I progress as a writer and a learner, I hope to improve on the organization of my writing pieces. At times, I find myself writing whatever comes out of my head, without thinking about where specific points of information belong, or where they would fit the best. I often find myself writing all over the place, rather than taking the time to organize my thoughts beforehand, or even sometimes at all! In order to combat this struggle that I often face, I'm going to attempt to make an outline for all of my works, to hopefully better compose my pieces.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Abigail Mayer =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} \ Abbey Mayer\ Professor Paku\ Purposeful Reflection\ 5 September 2019\ As I have grown and matured as a writer, one of the most important aspects of writing I have focused on is making each sentence purposeful. By making each sentence have a purpose a writer is engaging the reader with valuable analyzation and detail and text that contribute to the overall lesson or story of a writing piece. I find this skill to be very important because by making each sentence valuable to the overall argument, whatever I am trying to portray through writing comes out more clear and direct so there is no denying the message to the reader. While this a writing skill I am now consciously focusing on, it is a skill I have often struggled with in the past. My High School public speaking teacher helped me reflect on this skill when I was writing an argumentative speech on for class. As she helped revise my writing, she made me aware of multiple sentence I had put in their that didn't contribute to my argument or provide new information, instead I was basically repeating the analyzations I had previously made but just in different ways to emphasize a point. She helped me realize that especially in an argumentative piece, it can be best to not overanalyze, and instead make the sentences concise and to the point to catch the reader's attendance. This is still a skill I struggle with and am developing, but I find it very helpful when revising my essays; to take out any of my sentences where I tend to repeat the same information.\ Another aspect of my writing I would like to improve on, is the skill of citing properly in different styles. This is an area I struggled with in high school and hope I can develop this skill in college. I believe that through asking my professors and practicing the new and unfamiliar styles of citing sources and documenting quotes, I will eventually be able to successfully cite the appropriate sources in my writing. As I continue to grow as a writer in college, I look forward to sharpening the skills I already have and obtaining more skills that will make me a much stronger writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicholas Mazzola ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} <div> </div> ::: {#submission_preview .paper .user_content .enhanced} In my writing, I do well giving my own individual input, opinion, or analysis on a certain topic. Without this factor in my writing, it will just become a summary of data found elsewhere. I became more aware of how fond I was of analyzing things while writing for a music appreciation and criticism class I had at my old college. During an assignment, I took a song and broke it down in a few different ways, analyzing the song\'s literal structural, and the feelings it evokes. Points I would make included how \"the first minute and twenty-one seconds of this song move at 136 beats per minute,\" or how \"tempo is easiest to hear at 0:46 and 0:55 in the song where both guitarists play those triplets together.\" I would also provide more input, such as how I liked that this song is \"music that I can really sit down and *listen *to, rather than just hear.\" Breaking down the song, both technically, and emotionally came very easily for me. With this skill in mind, an aspect of my writing that could use more attention is making more use of sources. This was brought to my attention by the professor of the class that I wrote this assignment for, who claimed that I did a good job analyzing the song in my own way but could just use evidence more thoroughly to back it up. In the past, the use and analysis of sources would sometimes come up short in my writing, compared to a section that contains my own individual input. While I know how to use sources, it is still a weaker aspect of my writing that could be worked on. Using sources more advantageously will make my own input in writing more legitimate. ::: ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Malachy McAvoy ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus most on making sure my writing is clear and flows smoothly, almost as if someone were talking to you in a formal conversation. Without concise sentence structure that fits together properly, a piece of writing can sound choppy and deter the reader from continuing on. Similar to conversation, the overuse of too many arrogant words and terms can kill an essay. As a way to combat this, my 10th grade English teacher Mrs. Favre emphasized the practice of reading our papers aloud. This allowed us to hear the words being spoken directly and listen for awkward sounding phrases that needed to be fixed, as well as any grammatical errors. In doing so, my writing saw improved balance and clarity. One example of this would be me going from the statement "When you feel the sound in your appendages, it creates different feelings and emotions inside you that our ears would not be able to do on their own" to "Our limbs are an added resource that allow us to extend our listening capacity from just our ears, to a full body experience unlike any other." Rereading the initial sentence a few times can allow for a more simplistic, yet well-rounded idea to formulate.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I hope to improve on my introduction and thesis structuring. Many times in the past, I've struggled to begin my essays, especially with formulating a clear and well thought out thesis. I think some of this stems from my inability to always agree with one side of a topic and commit to it. If I start determining my own beliefs more and form ideas true to myself, I not only think the opening of my writing will improve drastically, but the writing as a whole. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sean McBride ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Sean McBride I am currently working at the writing skill of description because it creates a picture for the reader and makes for enjoyable literature. I blame my lack of efficiency in descriptive writing to the science courses I've taken that tell me to cut out the "fluff". So, as I revise my drafts I seemingly am always adding more description and detail. Although, it doesn't seem like it naturally flows afterwards, and it seems like my writing comes off as fake. In eleventh grade I was lucky to have a stellar SUPA History teacher. Every report that I submitted would be torn apart because of how hard and boring my papers were to read. I simply would submit the facts and that was just not exemplary writing for him. He sat me down and discussed how to craft my writing style for the better. His advice to me was to, "put myself in the persons scene and to think of what I would notice in that scene if I was there". This swiftly made a difference in my writing although I'm still honing my craft of description. So, for example in my most recent writing about a naval conflict I had this sentence, "my ship began to sink while my ankle was still attached to my bench". Reading that felt bland and boring so I decided to attempt to change it to this, "my ship began taking on water while my ankle was still bonded to the bench". While I felt that wasn't terrible, I decided to put myself in those shoes like my teacher said to. My final sentence ended up being, "the ship began to take on gallons of bone chilling water by the second, I began to panic as my ankle was still chained to this wretched bench". Never in my life had I used to write like this before, but not only does it make it more enjoyable to read but its exciting to write out these pictures. One aspect of writing that I need to vastly improve on is my grammar and punctuation. If I didn't have access to the grammar and punctuation checks of Microsoft word I would struggle writing properly. I am sometimes unaware of whether or not I should use certain punctuations in different scenarios. So, improving in that department would make writing easier and quicker for me. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Henry McCallion ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Although it is difficult to objectively assess one's writing, it is important to ascertain what skills one has developed for writing in order to continue improving.

I always think back to a time in highschool freshman year, everyone in my business class was so sure of an answer on a question our teacher asked us. The teacher asked everyone to stand on a certain side of the room, based off of what they thought the answer was. The whole class got up and moved to the right side of the room because they were so sure they had picked the right answer. My friends tried to get me to switch over but I didn't budge. I was confident with what I thought and wasn't going to give into the group consensus. When the teacher went over the answer It turned out I was right. Everyone doubted me but i wasn\'t afraid to speak my voice. I think what sets me aside from other writers so much is my emphasize on getting my point across. I've always been confident with my writing skills when proving a point in argumentative essays. It's important that as a writer you are confident in your work and can establish truth and factual evidence to where your work comes from. I think the person who helped me develop this awareness and important aspect of my writing is my mother. My mom has been an educator her whole life and growing up always made sure I knew the importance of being a strong outspoken writer.

In the past I have had professors stress that the statement should be as concise as possible with all the information needed in it, while containing no opinions or analysis.

This is an important skill to focus on because if you mix up verb tenses when writing it will confuse your professor and other audience members. For example, if you are talking about an event that happened in the 18^th^ century and you use a verb in the present tense it will confuse the reader because most events that occurred in the 18^th^ century do not occur in present day. The first time that this issue was pointed out to me was in my world history class my sophomore year of high school. I wanted to ensure that I was going in the right direction with my essay so I set up my meeting with my teacher and he pointed out that I was mixing up my verb tensing sometimes. After that I try to be super conscious about it and I read a lot of my papers out loud now because its easier to hear the mistake if it's said out loud. The last essay I wrote was for the school of education and in it I described an experience that I had working with a special needs child. In it I had to be sure that when I was reflecting on the experience and describing the experience, I used verbs in the past tense. I also had to be cautious because I also had to describe my feelings about the experience in the present so I had to ensure that those verbs were in the present tense. By reading it out loud I was able to ensure that there were no mistakes in my essay. One skill that I would like to learn how to do better is acknowledging and working in the other side of the argument. I know that this is a crucial piece of writing argument essays but I feel as though I have never been properly instructed on how to skillfully implement the other point of view in my writing without diminishing what I am saying about the topic. I am eager to learn how to do this and other skills successfully to make me a better writer and communicator.

The variety in sentence structure, transitions and format are the core issues my high school and middle school teachers pushed for in class. They would go over the many different ways to start a sentence, like transitional phrases, and the different lengths the sentences could be. Different sentence lengths and formats are important because if you were to read a paragraph or essay and all the sentences started the same way and were the same length, then it would be boring and repetitive. I remember learning the coordinating conjunctions in 8th grade and learning that they can connect ideas. My teacher taught us the FANBOYS acronym for it. For instance, I implemented some in my research paper last year, "People are capable of change, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**so**[ how they acted at one time can be different from how they act in the present due to experiences." To work on transitions she also had us write a paragraph and then jot down the first word of each sentence to show us that most of us used the same word in the beginning of sentences and that we needed to improve on that. I used tranitionals in my research paper too, " ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**However,**[ certain events or circumstances can trigger a person to act in a specific way and that it\'s not just built in them. People are capable of change, so how they acted at one time can be different from how they act in the present due to experiences. Genetics alone cannot determine how a person will act in a certain situation. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**Additionally,**[ how one grows up depends on what opportunity given to them by their parents." Along with that, I've learned how the usage of certain punctuation can help with sentence structures. Instead of writing two short sentences, I could use a comma or a semicolon as long as they are two independent ideas. I also used this in my research paper as well, "Even though people are genetically similar to their parents so traits are naturally formed**,** environmental factors and experiences are what affect human behavior and determine a person\'s personality." Overall, I'm not a big grammar person in general, so to me, I find sentence structure and construction of the overall idea important as opposed to little grammar mistakes. I like learning about the different ways to create and write out ideas in the form of sentences. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [For the future I definitely need to work on grammar and spelling and the little nitty gritty aspects of writing. I also find myself weak at creative writing and writing subjectively. Plus, I'm more of a math/science person where there is really only one answer, so I'm going to have to work on writing knowing there is no wrong answer. Making my sentences flow better is something else I would like to improve upon as well. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily McIntosh ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As I write my essays, I largely focus on making sure that I don't over-explain the point I'm trying to make. This has been difficult for me because as a writer I tend to want to write more than necessary. Since all the High School classes I took that had helped guide me with a template on how to analyze specific literary elements/techniques, I've begun to realize how easy it was to cut down on the extra redundant sentences. For example, when I was a junior, I submitted a paper explaining how the quote I found in the reading, helped bring in the literary element/technique I was specifically focusing on in my paper. When I got my paper back however, my teacher circled the extra sentence where I mindlessly wrote a summary of my previous sentence. Instead of my teacher taking points off, he told me to be careful to not repeat or summarize unless I'm concluding the paper altogether. Since then, I've tried cutting down on extra sentences and words that will not help in the long run. Another example would be using too many words and going over the word count just to get what I have to say across. I\'ve been able to cut down especially around the time where I started writing a lot of scholarship essays. The reason for this was because there was a word count, and with the word count in place, I realized I needed to efficiently and effectively get my point across. An example using an essay that was too wordy would be \". Teaching is so in-depth and intriguing which only makes me want to learn more about all the different aspects behind it as well as learning the dynamic of forming a fun and engaging lesson plan. The dynamics of a kindergarten teacher are so complex compared to that of high school teachers\". As you can see I restated the first sentence that didn\'t need the extra summary in the second sentence. I want to not only meet the word count but to also explain my point thoroughly. And this is difficult for me as I\'ve already gone past the word count for this assignment. I personally believe that I'm not as confident as I'd like to be in my work, which would help explain why I reiterate all the time. I'd like to develop better writing skills to help me become a knowledgeable writer. I'm excited to continue writing, as it's a skill most my friends say it's an incredible talent I possess. Most of these friends actually encouraged me to pursue English as my major, and if not to try and continue pursuing this passion I have to write. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Connor Mclaughlin =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing I would like to get better at is getting better at weaving quotes into the overall nararative of the piece I am writing. I have always found it difficult to properly put a quote from a source I am citing into say an essay in an organic manner. It just always ends up seeming clunky or unnatural to put a quote long enough to make sense into a writing piece. Since a high school English teacher once told me that I would get a much better score in college writing were I to acquire this skill. I believe, since that teach informed me, that it is pertinent to be able to put in a quote in a way that does not break the general flow of an essay in such a way that it can confuse the reader about the voice of the essay and what I mean to convey. I believe I can start to improve this by putting phrases such as \"In the book, the author states\...\" before the quote or have in the previous sentence stated something about the quote then using it. However I believe the second method would also break up the flow of an essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Holly McRobbie ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I took a college writing class called SUPA Writing 105 senior year of highschool. This class helped me grow tremendously as a writer and a student. I wrote research papers, analysis papers, and even my college essay in this class. The major thing I focused on was moving away from the "five paragraph theme" theme. The five paragraph theme is what we were taught is middle school. My teacher urged us to break out of the mold and to explore other writing styles. Since I cannot copy and paste my whole old essays it is hard to show evidence to support this. This is an excerpt from an end of the course reflection I wrote: "I never really thought about how I formed my essays. I just did what they\'ve been teaching us. I realized how much you can develop an idea just by switching things up." How I changed was by exploring multiple ideas throughout the whole essay instead of keeping different topics in separate paragraphs. This provided me with a more in depth and mature essay. Another place I grew as a writer was choosing sources for my essay. I did rhetorical sourcing precis to make sure the source was not only reliable but also relevant to my essay topic. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In future essays I would like to use more advanced vocabulary. This would overall elevate the professionalism of my future work. Another thing I will work on doing is focusing on all view points in an argument and all the stakeholders. This helps eliminate bias. I hope my writing continues to develop throughout this year the same way it did last year. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Patrick McTiernan =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [My biggest focus when writing is my quote integration, because I feel it is one of the most important parts of forming a cohesive argument. I feel that an argument can be weakened when quotes dominate a writing piece or when they do not flow with the rest of the piece. My Social Studies teachers in highschool would always emphasize how we used our quotes in our research papers. We were taught to use the acronym ICE (introduce, cite, explain) when adding quotes. One of my teachers also wouldn't even read your essay if it were majority quotes. An example of poor quote integration would be "In the New York Times, they say 'emergency officers have received at least 200 frantic calls from people stranded on their rooftops and attics' showing how intense the storm really is." This quote may be added correctly, but it doesn't flow very well. I would correct it to something along the lines of "the strength of the storm is shown by how emergency officers are being stretched thin with 'at least 200 frantic calls from people stranded on rooftops and attics'(New York Times)." I think the use of internal citations and weaving the quote in with my own words allows for my own ideas to be more prevalent than that of the quote I am using.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I want to develop my use of conventions and grammar further. I sometimes struggle to catch grammar mistakes in my writing, and I also feel that my understanding of conventions is still pretty basic. I think as I go on to write more sophisticated pieces of writing it will be important for me to be able to acknowledge and correct my grammar. Having a stronger foothold in it will also allow me to experiment with new, more advanced writing structures.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Daniel Mecca ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I am writing, I first want to answer any question or statement given by the prompt. I believe that at least doing this gives me a decent chance to obtain points and a better grade. I use evidence and quotes well in my writing, fully explaining them in depth their relevance in supporting my argument. I take time and good thoughts into my thesis because in my opinion it is the most important piece in writing essays. I make sure that they are credible enough to where I can easily support and find evidence. In highschool we had to write an essay of a downfall of a character, and I chose Creon from *Antigone*. I first created a thesis as to why the downfall of the character unfolded. The thesis I used was that excessive pride led to the downfall of Creon. So then in my essay I used the best quotes that involved his selfishness/excessive pride, and explained how they got him deeper and deeper into problems. Then I explained in full detail the relevance of why this was important. By doing these things, I answered the essay prompt and supported my own thesis thus resulting in a satisfactory grade. What I would like to improve on in my writing is my creativity, flow, and sound. I think I sound more like a robot than a person at times. My writing is too vague because I am too focused on answering the prompt, ultimately weakening my argument. This year, I want my point to be clear because I know I can back it up. Transitioning has been in a weakness in my writing as well. Usually, I have so many things that I want to say, that I become overwhelmed which leads to not being able to fully get my point across. In my previous essays from highschool, my teachers would say that I would ramble too much or move on to a different point too quickly. For example, I would use a quote with a great explanation and argument, to only just state another quote out of nowhere. My goal is to obtain a good use of transition words so that my writing has a better flow to it. I have strong pieces but also weak pieces, so I hope that it can all come together well. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Reghan Meek ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing I focus a lot on maintaining a good flow throughout my pieces. I think this is important because I don't want to stray off on tangents or be all over the place and lose the reader. I also want to avoid being redundant and having the piece tough to read through. I am more comfortable and aware of this skill thanks to my tenth grade english teacher. I have a clear memory from her class where I had turned in my first paper for the year and when it was handed back I did so poorly on it. I went to go speak with her for extra help and she explained to me that my main points were scattered throughout and not connected to specific paragraphs. In addition I also had very little transition words and the transitions I did use were very redundant. These issues were causing my paper to be choppy. She took the time to help me improve and gave me suggestions for transition words. Before 10th grade I would often repeat phrases such as, "Then the author supports their point..." and now I use a variety of phrases like, "In addition, the author explains....". From that point on I have focused on using a larger variety of transition words and making sure my points are connected and relevant.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my future writings I would really like to improve on adding a strong, clear voice. My writing right now I think is around average, but by developing a stronger voice I think it could help take my writing to the next level. It could help add a sense of maturity and professionalism. In addition it may keep readers interested in what I am writing about. I could start to do this by being more concise and captivating in my wording and introduction.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Olivia Meemken ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on giving key details in my papers, to help emphasise on the topic that I have been assigned. This helps to expand my paper with information that will help not only myself but the reader as well, to better understand what I am writing about. Through my own knowledge of the assignment topic, plus the help of outside information I feel I am able to make the concept of what I am writing about easier to understand. Throughout high school and middle school I was faced with many different teachers who expected different things out of my short stories, essays, and projects. Due to this my writing style was always changing but one thing that remained the same was the use of detail in every writing assignment I was given. In my junior year of high school my English teacher really focused on being able to take your writing piece and add to it by replacing words such as \"that\" and \"it\" with what the that and it really were. For example instead of a simple sentence such as, \" I remember that.\" you would write \" I remember the time we went on vacation and stayed at the beach.\" Adding this to the writing helps to not only lengthen the paper but provide the reader with more information as to what is going on. As I go through this course and the rest of my time at Geneseo I hope I am able to better understand that too much detail can be an issue. Sometimes I find myself adding more information than is necessary for the reader to understand my text. I would also like to find improvement in areas of writing skills such as, focus. Focus tends to be an issue sometimes as I just throw details into the writing and it can become jumbled due to the fact that some information may be out of place. Although adding details to my work is one of my string suites when writing long pieces it can become difficult to keep the writing clear. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Garrett Meier =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Garrett Meier INTD 106-01 Dr. Paku Due: Sept. 5th, 2019 The writing skills I feel most confident about are my transitions and flow. My ability to seamlessly connect sentences so that ideas are not lost, help me to produce better papers. I have shown this in the first assignment I submitted to my INTD 105-09 class. We were asked to produce a paper telling the professor a little bit about our background and what our aspirations at Geneseo would be. I begin by explaining that, "By the time I was 14 I had moved about 7 different times, changing school districts between Connecticut, Florida, and New York." To connect this idea to my explanation, I began the next sentence by writing that, "This type of change comes as a struggle for many, but because it became so normal for me, I looked at it as an opportunity." By beginning my introduction with a story and transitioning into the explanation of how it affected me, I made the paper both more personal, and in-depth. With having a strong start, I needed a strong ending as well. After transitioning into my aspirations for Geneseo and explaining which clubs I wanted to join, I flowed into my closing sentence; "With participation in these clubs I hope to grow as an adult and as a part of the Geneseo community." By increasing fluidity in my writing, I was able to connect my main ideas to my evidence, emphasizing the subject. After proving my experience to be the source of my aspirations, I was able to end the paper with clarity on what my goals at Geneseo would be, leaving no room for the reader to be confused. Through my transitions and fluidity, I hope to continue to produce papers that leave the readers with a clear understanding of what I wrote about and why I wrote about it. To improve my writing, I hope to use more creative writing language such as metaphors, similes, etc in the future. While my use of transitions allow me to connect my ideas in a cohesive manner, the content could become more interesting with the use of these literary devices. I feel held back when trying to forcefully put these in my writing rather than letting them come naturally. Through my classes and online writing courses, I hope I can improve on this skill. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kiersten Mejak ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [While writing, I make sure that all of my points are detailed and clear. Doing this is important because it ensures that the reader of my work will be able to understand what I am explaining to them. I have always been the type of writer to thoroughly explain my thought process, but in my senior year of high school, my English teacher taught me how to be more concise with my explanations. This became prevalent after I handed in a research paper that was three times the length of the required page count. Although my English teacher was enthralled that I had put in so much time and effort into my writing, he explained to me that I didn't need to type vast amounts of information to make readers understand my writing. After this assignment I worked with this teacher to learn how to make concise, yet understandable arguments. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future I would like to focus on using better vocabulary in my writing. Although I feel that I already use an extensive amount of vocabulary, I would like to expand and improve it. I always fall into the habit of describing things as "very good", "very bad", or using the word "really" too much. I will improve my vocabulary by saying things such as "magnificent" or "horrendous" instead. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [\ \ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christopher Melnik ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One skill I have focused on consciously during my writings and after when I revise them is only using relevant important information. This is a skill I struggled with in the past, but over the past couple of years with more and more experience under my belt towards writing I realized that I tend to put in a lot of \"fluff\" information as my teachers used to call it, or just information that did not support or was not relevant to the topic. My teachers helped me develop this skill as in almost all of my writings in the beginning of high school had the same feedback saying I had an excess of irrelevant information, but now I can confidently say that this is a strong skill of mine as I now understand what is relevant and what is not, making my writings stronger and more concise. This is shown in my college essay as after the first draft my essay was full of information that didn\'t support who I was, but after a couple of revisions i slowly worked my way down and picked out and tweaked information and put together a really strong concise essay. One skill that I wish to develop upon is the structure of my writings. I feel as when I write my writings do not always flow as I want them to. They never really seen to be as continuous connected thoughts they seem to be very broken apart and so I feel that piecing together my thoughts better would make my writings a lot stronger. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Carolyn Merced ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I consciously focus on organization in my writing. I sometimes have trouble organizing my papers well when I do not have a template to base it off of. This lack of organization in my essays can sometimes undermine the rest of my work, as organization is extremely important to develop points and arguments well. I believe that my organization skills improved greatly when I took the Capstone program, AP Seminar and AP Research in high school. My teacher, Mr. Storck, emphasized the importance of organizational skills to the class and focused on revising student essays by rearranging them. For instance, when I first wrote my Individual Research Report for my AP exam, it was very poorly organized in that the introductory paragraph was too long and too detailed. Mr. Storck taught me that although I had good information in the introduction, such as specific dates and statistics, it was too long and some of that information should really be only in the body paragraphs as evidence or it will seem too repetitive. I changed my introduction and I think I greatly improved my writing by the end of senior year. In the future, I would like to further the development of my own writing style when it comes to research papers. I believe that my style in fiction and narrative writing is well developed, but I have always struggled with making papers my own rather than writing based off of a template. To fix this, I am going to try to write more often and not base it off of someone else\'s style, which will hopefully improve my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lindsay Merenda ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Lindsay Merenda ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When I write an argumentative essay I try to focus on using the technique of comparing and contrasting. I like to provide examples on how two authors share different views on the same topic. By using comparing and contrasting technique in my writing, I am able to argue and defend a topic. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I like to think that I am fairly confident in my writing due to the help from International Baccalaureate teachers in high school and from my brother (who is a lawyer).

Then in my body paragraphs I use the compare and contrast technique to argue both sides. In my last writing I had to write about two different educators in two different time periods and compare their similarities and different views on education. These two writers were John Henry Newman and Rabindranath Tagore. Their views on education that should be viewed as freeing which not only helps the mind but also the body. An example of my comparison technique would be these two quotes I used in my past essay: "a school should work with the natural curiosity of a child's mind to stimulate creativity and understanding ... It should not be an "education factory" that warehouse students and teachers..." (Tagore 41) and "\...argues that a true education need not, in many cases cannot, be attached to practical purposes." (Newman 31)". After acquiring these two quotes, I make sure they work together to defend and deny the argument I am making. Tagore uses the metaphor of an education factory to the school system and how the school system is not helping society. Newman bring in the idea that when government tries to take part in education destroys it. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Nevertheless in going forward with my writing, I'd like to concentrate on explaining the quotes rather than relying heavily on quotes to explain themselves. I want to improve my explanations to prove to the reader why I am using the quote.

This is important because I need my reader to understand the message I'm trying to convey in my writing, whether it's a serious or comedic subject all depends on the proper word choice. If the incorrect word is used than the essay's message is weakened and can even in extreme cases create an essay with an uneven tone that confuses the reader. This skill was aided by my mother who was a heavy reader who helped me to expand my vocabulary that allowed me to cherry pick the exact words I needed to utilize in my formal writing. I feel that if I continue to read and challenge my comprehension skills then I can continue to expand ability to create a powerful tone. An example of my weak tone I initially used was the quote from my original admissions essay "I found history to be boring and no longer worth being bothered with." This quote shows a borderline comedic tone to what should be an inspiring or at the very least formal writing piece. With a couple word choices, the quote became "I originally found the subject of history to be tedious and no longer required by modern society, but I was swiftly enlightened." These new word choices add a sense of grandeur to the writing that it lacked and sounds far more professional. Later in the essay I try to illustrate the importance of history by giving the example "Like the Viking Erikson exploring Canada." This phrase isn't incorrect, but it once again lacks the edge I need, instead I used "Suddenly, like Leif Erikson stepping on the icy shores of the Hudson." This adds much needed sensory information that makes my essay come alive and stands out more to the reader.]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":480}"} [In the ensuing year I would like to concentrate on making more complex sentence structures.

In order to prove my claim to my readers I must have evidence to back it up. Without proof, the claim I am making is simply just a statement. In order to use textual support properly, I follow an organized method of writing. First, I introduce the topic, cite supporting evidence and then explain that evidence. After my explanation of the evidence, I artfully transition into the next topic. This is an important skill to have because it sets up my papers in a way that is easy to follow from a readers standpoint. I learned the importance of this skill in my freshman year of high school when my English teacher taught the format to my class. I was in awe of the steps that should be taken to form a clear and concise paper. I am very thankful to my freshman English teacher for showing me how an essay should be written. Even though I made some mistakes with the format in the beginning, he helped me improve as the year went on. The most recent writing assignment that I wrote included a lot of evidence to back up my claim. In one of my paragraphs my introduction was that "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Tagore considers education to be something that students should enjoy, which is why he wants to encourage a nature centralized atmosphere." I then cited a quote that Tagore used in his writing; "He says that 'children should be surrounded with the things of nature which have their own educational value' (Tagore 42). After using this evidence I had to explain the quote to my readers by saying that "he emphasizes the importance of inner development when relating to learning and simply wishes that the students become better rather than perfect." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In future assignments, I'd like to use a larger variety of vocabulary. I often tend to re-use the same words once I have used them already. For example, instead of reusing the word "better" I would try to use different words like "improve" or "advance" to make my writing sound less repetitive.

I am confident that providing a plethora of evidence is a skill I do very well, because in high school, my English teacher would always acknowledge that I had done a wonderful job of completing that particular task when writing a paper. For example, If my claim were to be that exercise leads to a positive mindset, I would provide evidence from articles and find data and statistics from outside sources that would help to back up my claim and support it.

Before I started making that a goal of my writing I would write papers and add information to the piece that was not necessarily important. There would also be repeated information worded in a different way. I have worked on making this a focus of mine when I am writing and challenging myself to find information or dive deeper into the topic to give it more depth but still making it intentional. This skill is important because it demonstrates that I have a good understanding of what I am writing about. It also shows that I am confident in what I am writing about because I am giving the simple important information and supporting to the extent that I do not need to add unnecessary information. This is an example of my first response paper for my history class from my first semester last year. "Starting in the Zhou Dynasty the political structure started as a divided country, known as the warring states. During this time, the Zhou house could not keep control over all of the territory and this resulted in a multi state system giving each state their own freedom". The content in these two sentences is basically the same thing or could have been turned into a different statement that contained the important information. My eleventh grade history teacher would always remind us to give a statement, explain it, and then move on. He would force us to keep it as simple as possible to avoid the extra information so that it was known that we knew what we were talking about. While I continue learning about my writing I wish to focus on better transitions in sentences and topics. This is something that I have struggled with throughout my school career.

As a chemistry major, I am mostly focused on writing lab reports that are as informative and easily understood by the general public. Due to this, I think that something I put a lot of effort into when writing is making sure that I will not be confusing the reader. I try to simplify things a lot because it is necessary when writing scientific papers and lab reports, where not all of the readers know much about the topic I am writing about. Most recently, I wrote a 7-page report last semester for a chemistry lab that I took. This report required a full procedure to ensure that another person could read the report and repeat the experiment with similar results. After I submitted my first draft of the report for review, my professor commented on my procedure that I should "include details about all glassware used and provide specific measurements of how long each step of the experiment need to run for." After I received this comment, I made sure that I provided the exact instruments used and specified the length of time that the experiment needed to proceed for in each stage. Paying greater attention to detail in this portion of my lab report allowed me to receive an A on the final draft, so I made sure to be very thorough in the rest of my work for the semester.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An aspect of my writing that I think I would really like to improve upon is using evidence to back up my thesis statements and properly explaining why the evidence makes my argument stronger.

I think that sometimes I worry I am choosing improper quotes to support my argument, but I don't know how to find anything better, so I ended up doing poor work with what I have found.

When I write I struggle to put some of my thoughts and explanations into words that make sense. I end up stuck in my own brain, unable to convey abstract ideas. When I revise my drafts, I make sure to keep this in mind in order to specifically look out for areas where this may be a problem. When working on editing several drafts of a research proposal, my teacher of the course this was for helped me realize the power of peer reviewing drafts. I had had my peers look at other work in the past, but in this class, the teacher required us to peer review every single piece of writing that we turned in, and I found that listening to how others interpreted my work was enlightening. In my research proposal, for example, I was able to condense several long, wordy sentences into "This does not mean that there is no possibility of reducing fitness costs, however, as it may be possible to reduce resistance in various ways, such as..." in order to simplify and clarify my point. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [During my time at Geneseo, I would like to be able to learn more strategies in order to more effectively communicate my points in a way that easily understood by others.

I achieve this in my writing by first, creating an outline which I will use while writing my paper to make sure I cover all the topics. As well as where I place these ideas and facts such as in the introduction, body paragraph, conclusion, etc. The most important part in achieving a nicely flowing paper or order in the paper is in the outline. For example, if I am writing an email, about a question on a homework assignment I will start with an introduction, "Dear Professor Green, my name is Eva Miller. I hope you are having a wonderful evening I had a quick question about how to submit the assignment- Think Piece \#1." This introduction states who I am interested in talking to, introducing myself and then what I am writing about in the email. Then I like to move onto the main point in the email or what I would like to get a response about, "I have completed the assignment- Think Piece \#1 and was looking to submit it. I have checked on canvas and I do not see a submission link or space. Is there another way to submit this assignment before the deadline?" This middle part of the email states that I have completed the assignment and checked canvas to submit it but have a question which is clearly stated about where to submit it. Finally, is the conclusion that wraps up the email and thanks the professor, "I would love to submit this assignment, please let me know when you have a chance. Thank you so much for you time, Eva Miller." In the future, I would like to work on using sophisticated language and better wording. I often find myself writing very quickly because I get an idea and run with it. I would like to slow down in my writing to use better language to sound more profession in writings such as research papers. Using sophisticated language will help show the reader I took time into writing the paper and researched appropriately.

I tend to give points in my writing but then struggle to back up the point with evidence. In the past, I have had teachers focus on different things in my writing. Some high school teachers would correct grammar, and some would correct things such as explaining evidence. When they would correct explaining evidence, they would tell me to break down the pieces of evidence following the claim. The teachers would tell me to give the claim, give evidence for that claim, and explain where that evidence came from and what it reveals. On a past document-based paper I had written about the Cold War, I had made a claim regarding a document but had not backed it up with the direct evidence. This would invalidate the claim I was trying to make which is why it must be corrected. In Geneseo, I would like to improve upon how my writing looks to a larger audience. I want my writing to sound not only good on paper, but sound good out loud as well.

By using a book, essay, article, or quote, I show how my argument is supported by other sources or that I have evidence to support my claim. An example would be, "Mark Twain demonstrating how Jim feels after Huck reveals his hurtful prank". I also focus on what the information means, not just that I have the information. To express this in my writing, I will add "Mark Twain illustrates how African Americans deserve the same respect and rights as Caucasions by demonstrating how Jim feels after Huck reveals his hurtful prank". I learned this skill in high school when I took AP Literature. I learned that it is not enough to simply state information. I have to illustrate why it is meaningful or important. Information is useless unless it has a purpose. To make my argument even more relevant, I explain even further why this information is important. "Mark Twain illustrates how African Americans deserve the same respect and rights as Caucasions by demonstrating how Jim feels after Huck reveals his hurtful prank, illuminating Twain's recurring theme of the inequality between African Americans and Caucasions".\ However, there are areas that I could improve upon. I feel nervous in my analysis of articles, essays, and other works. I feel that at times I don't go deep enough into a work to bring about adequate insight. This causes my writing to be well worded, but flat and lacking depth. I hope that throughout this course, I can gain greater insight and make my writing deeper. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kimberly Mistretta ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} An aspect of writing I consciously focus on is developing a good thesis statement that I can find enough good information to back it up with in my body paragraphs. It is important to focus on this while writing because it helps for me to keep all my information flowing smoothly together. In the past I struggled a lot with creating a good thesis and having good evidence to support my claim, but my eleventh and twelfth grade English teachers gave my class outlines on how to come up with a good thesis and they personally gave me advice such as expanding my thesis cause it was too vague, and showed me examples of better statements to work with. By receiving all that help, I finally understood what was expected in a thesis and knew to make sure my thesis could be supported by my knowledge and information I had on the topic I was asked to write about. I was able to develop a thesis statement on my own for most of my papers in twelfth grade and started to make my writing stronger by finding evidence that supported my thesis well, which was noticed by my teacher. An example of a thesis statement that helped me write a strong essay was, "Shirley Jackson is well known for her love of architecture and use of setting throughout her stories. Through her use of setting, she is able to make her characters more dynamic and show her readers the positive and negative affects setting has on her characters thoughts and actions." I was able to support this thesis through evidence from author Shirley Jackson's novels and the knowledge I had about her and her life. An aspect of writing I want to develop effectively is my wording. While writing I struggle with finding the right way to word sentences. I've had an English teacher comment that my sentence was written awkwardly, and I hope the classes and assignments I will experience at Geneseo will improve my writing skills and make me more confident about writing. The best way for me improve would be to practice writing, learn from my mistakes, and to read. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Esther Molloy =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Esther Molloy]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self Reflection]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When I write, oftentimes, I have problems with commas and voice. My issue with commas stems primarily from my lack of education on how to use them. For instance, I was taught a parenthetical comma and where to place a comma when using particular phrases, but lots of times I put commas where I believe there should be a pause. For example in one of my pieces of writing I use the sentence, "I climb on the linoleum countertop, putting the food in the microwave I tried to keep my balance on the greasy counter." and it is what my father would call a Frankenstein sentence, because I am taking two connected independent ideas and mashing them together. In order to fix my grammatical errors I have to slow down and carefully read because if I take the time, I can understand what doesn't sound right and go about fixing it from there. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Voice, for me, is a very different problem. You can probably tell oftentimes, I like to write as if I am speaking, and in many academic settings, this isn't very good.

I find this skill to be important when persuading or reflecting on something so readers can understand what I'm trying to say to them. I try to keep the structure cohesive and related so it isn't overwhelming with information or falling off track as to where I want to take the reader's thoughts. When I met with English teachers in high school, in regards to my college application, and the essay that I struggled to write, they all encouraged that I stay on the topic I felt was most important to me, and to keep it precise to that specific topic. It helped me moving forward, as a student, to write more efficient papers and to focus on the topic I was given or chose to touch upon. I would like to become better at starting papers moving forward. Once I have a thesis to my writing, it becomes easy for me to write the body of the paper but introducing an idea has always been difficult for me. In a paper I recently wrote for a writing class, I received feedback from my teacher. My teacher wrote that my first paragraph was long and poorly constructed. I agree that the way I begin to discuss an idea can sometimes sound awkward and doesn't completely tell readers what the rest of the paper will be about. This paper was on the topic of criminality, both in general and in the town of a novel we read. I started off by talking about how there isn't one simple definition of a criminal, "In this novel it's clear that there isn't one simple definition of a criminal. All the criminals in *Red Harvest*who are considered "criminal" are all classified as such for different reasons, and they are all involved with a variety of groups in society." I introduced an idea of criminality in general and then I used that to speak on the criminals in the book, but quickly started introducing other ideas all in the first paragraph. This is what made it very long and poorly constructed. Later in the first paragraph I talked about how the main character is very controversial and this didn't make sense to tie together in the first paragraph alone. I wrote: "In Personville there is so much corruption that often the gangsters blend in with the rest of the town's population. The police officers of the town are corrupt in their own way, and they almost always escape the punishments they deserve for their behavior. The Op is a very controversial character because he is seen differently by every reader." ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mason Moon ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Mason Moon INTD 106-01 Self-Reflection\# 1 Your Writing Priorities 9/3/2019 I mainly focus on supporting my arguments with evidence. I think it's always an important step to support your claims as it helps make stronger persuasive statements and build powerful arguments. Getting your point clearly across to the reader is always the focus of my argumentative essay. Back in high school, my teachers helped me understand the importance of strong arguments with backing evidence. For example, on my college admissions essay, I gave evidence on how my experiences at volunteering at a hospital gave me lots of thought about the freedom we have. At first, I didn't provide any evidence on how my experiences at the hospital helped to realize how broad our freedom is. "When I volunteered at a hospital called New York Presbyterian Queens Hospital in the summer of 2017, it helped me to understand what freedom meant to me." This is the sentence lacking evidence. After I supported my statement, the sentence goes as follows, "Imet a teenage boy who was passionate about sports, but he could not play until his fracture in his leg healed. I realized that freedom is not only a limited prison but with health. Freedom is precious, and it cannot be controlled by my behavior." Moreover, I would like to learn more about the rules of grammar because grammar is an important skill in writing. Good grammar skills will convey ideas clearly to the reader. English is not my first language and therefore I would like to be more cautious when it comes to grammar. I hope by the end of this course, I will have a clear understanding of important writing skills, especially the skills I am lacking in. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kevin Moran ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I'm writing a paper, I normally focus on trying to get my point across with the use of professional language, but in such a way that I don't lose any of my own voice. Finding a good balance between the two is important, as it allows me to showcase my knowledge in a believable manner without losing the interest of the audience. Since I was young, my dad has always had this way of speaking that made him sound professional while maintaining a friendly and comfortable atmosphere around his words, and he's acknowledged that I often do the same. For instance, in my college application essay, I wrote "In a society where little is fostered except aggression and competition, especially in boys, I'm one of the lucky few who are considered caring and thoughtful." Through the use of phrases such as "little is fostered," a respectable degree of formality is achieved, and is contrasted lightly by more common phrases such as "one of the lucky few," allowing the reader to feel more comfortable through word choice alone. At the time of writing the essay, I believed this style worked well, as did my twelfth grade AP English teacher.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One skill I would like to improve upon is the ability to make my point clear with the use of fewer words.

I have been constructively criticized on citing works incorrectly because certain things are italicized and others, like websites, are recorded with the authors last name or publisher. I have used resources like OWL at Purdue, which has aided me in finding the correct format. I used in an MLA formatted research essay, "('How Successful People', 2015)", when citing an electronic source - categorized as web pages, online news, or magazine articles. The correct way to cite this source is by including the author's name - if the same work is referred to more than once - and then the article name. In my instance this would look like, "(Irvine, 'How Successful People')". This skill has been carried through my entire high school career, and I am certain will continue to be needed throughout college. OWL at Purdue has been a blessing of a resource because I don't think research papers will ever go away, or assignments that require citing, for that matter. Although I have worked on this issue, I still have a particular predicament in writing.\ I have once described my writing dilemma as, not writer's block, but writer's river. One, once an idea comes to fruition my mind works faster than my hands can type/write it out; and two, one idea leads to the next and my river of thoughts start to become side streams and take a different direction in relevance, ultimately leading me further and further from my prompt, or original idea. Often, I have a lot to say but some things are better left out concerning the strength of their importance, or I over explain using many sentences which can be cut down using one concise, strong statement. This is something I would love to work on. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Maeve Morley ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Maeve Morley August 31, 2019 INTD 106-01: Conventions of College Writing Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities One aspect of my academic writing that I make sure to focus on is thoroughly analyzing the sources I'm providing in my essays, rather than just merely giving a summarization of them. Not only is this skill crucial for making sure I'm presenting my own piece of writing and ideas, but also in supporting the overall argument of my essay by explaining how the sources I chose specifically relates to my thesis. An essay outline that one of my professors helped me create last year was highly beneficial to my future writing and significantly improved it. This outline reminds me to not summarize my argument by only presenting evidence that relates to the key terms in my thesis, but by explaining how and why it relates, thus actually supporting my thesis. It helps me draw attention to the "who," "what," and "why," instead of just the "what." An example would be if I was writing an essay on how students were an influential part during the American Civil Rights Movement. One of my examples would be how college students organized sit-ins at restaurants where they weren't welcome. Instead of just stating, "Sit-ins, such as the first initial ones in Greensboro, were led by college students, thus asserting that they were an influential part of the American Civil Rights Movement," I would link it to the thesis by writing, "Sit-ins, such as the first initial ones in Greensboro, helped spark the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement by preaching injustice nonverbally and nonviolently. Many of these were assisted by college students, while considered young and immature in the eyes of critics, were one of the first individuals to stand up against the social injustices put upon them." As of currently, I'd like to focus more on building a solid outline for my essays before I begin writing them. I think if I give myself more time and write out an outline with a solid amount of evidence and sources, the actual writing portion of the essay will be much easier. I don't give myself enough time to work on my essays, so I think that allowing myself the time to work on an outline prior to writing my essay, will help in the time management aspect. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Janiqua Morris ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on providing strong, relatable evidence to the claims I make in an essay. This is important because if I make a very strong point, but I don\'t have valid, matching supporting evidence to reinforce it, then my point becomes weak and confusing for readers to understand. An example of this can be seen from my history exam last semester. I made the claim that "Women's participation in the antislavery movement paved the way to further public activism by going against social norms". I supported this statement by referencing Sarah and Angelina ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Grimké and how they implored their message: "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Through letters, and speeches the ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Grimké sisters strongly advocated for other women to begin speaking out on against slavery and to write petitions and appeals to Congress. In document 7, "Angelina Grimké: Appeal to the Christian Women of the South, 1836", Angelina is urging women to not be passive bystanders to the issue of slavery. Every action taken, whether it's big or small, can help towards bringing about change. She urges her female audience that by speaking out, reading on the subject of slavery, educating others about it, and acting on the subject, they are contributing to the cause".]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While I am able to provide strong evidence to support my claims, something that I need to improve on is being able to explain why an example is important. Referring back to the same history exam from above, my professor had left several comments reflecting this: "again explain why this example matters", and "good arguments, you should make an effort to connect your examples with your main arguments". I need to work on explaining how the evidence I choose reflects the bigger picture of the point I'm trying to convey. I think this will allow for clearer transitions and make my essay stronger overall because I will be able to make deeper connections. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cliona Morrow =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ As a writer, I am constantly growing and learning, trying to find new ways to express my ideas coherently and effectively. To that point, I am always trying to improve my vocabulary use in my academic writing. I feel that it's important to use words which creatively add to my arguments, as well as keep my writing interesting and varied. Papers, essays, or other academic writing can tend to get monotonous and formulaic, and I feel that engaging, sophisticated vocabulary helps to more clearly illustrate my point in a new and interesting way. In the past, my English teachers have always helped me in finding new ways to express my thoughts, because I tend to use the same adjectives or phrases repeatedly in my writing. They have always offered me advice about the way I structure my sentences and the flow of my writing. I have tried my best to follow their advice and make these changes. For example, instead of saying "Education is the best way for students to escape poverty", I said "Education is a vital component in the equation that leads to the success of disadvantaged students and their escape from poverty". The second sentence is far more engaging to the reader, and uses both more sophisticated word choice and sentence structure. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ An area of writing that I'd like to improve upon is arguing my point effectively and concisely. I tend to ramble and over-explain every one of my points, which causes my essays and papers to be too long and overly repetitive. I think this is because I am always conscious that I might not be explaining my argument in the best way possible, so I want to exhaust all possibilities of phrasing to make sure my point is translated properly.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Andrew Mosbo ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When composing papers, essays, or arguments, I tend to focus on the strength of quotations or points. It is how I show my viewpoint of a controversial topic, or support a statement given to me by a professor. Using strong points and strong explanation creates a very good paper. Finding the strongest evidence can be extremely difficult at times, but it is necessary. Without strong evidence, papers can seem pointless to read. Recently, I was assigned a response to the story Reason written by Isaac Asimov. The response was to the question "Is QT-1's ideology rational?" QT-1 is a robot created by two people on a space station who believes he was made by The Master. Finding evidence to support this was simple, as it is an opinion-based question, but strong evidence was still a good idea. I used the following as my reasoning:]{style=";"} [ ]{style=";"} "I, on the other hand, am a finished product. I absorb electrical energy directly and utilize it with an almost one hundred percent efficiency. I am composed of strong metal, am continuously conscious, and can stand extremes of environment easily. These are facts which, with the self-evident proposition that no being can create another being superior to itself, smashes your silly hypothesis to nothing." (Asimov 37) [ ]{style=";"} [Using this, I was able to back my side by stating QT-1's idea of humans not being able to create superior beings is rational when thought about. Without evidence, it seems reasonable to believe. This was the strongest part of my response alongside the explanation of the quotation.]{style=";"} [The biggest influence on my life when it comes to writing is my junior year English teacher, Mr. Phaneuf. He was one of the first English teachers I\'ve had that stressed the structure and development of sentences and responses. He helped me improve how I write by focusing more on individual sentences rather than just assign essays. He helped me turn my writing around and I have only him to thank for that so far.]{style=";"} [ ]{style=";"} [Going through this course and other writing courses, I'd like to improve the flow and the word choices of my compositions. Often, it is hard for me to start and continue an essay and keep a nice flow to the words. The arguments still have proper flow, but some sentences do not work together. Transitions can also be difficult between paragraphs. I hope that this course can solidify my writing ability. ]{style=";"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Bridget Moyer =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing I make a point to focus on adequately explaining my quotes. I feel confident is choosing and placing my quotes, but it takes more of a conscious effort for me to show how they support my thesis. One their own, quotes from a text can assist me in supporting my ideas but using them to make a broader point requires more in-depth clarification. This skill is necessary to create a paper that delves more deeply into a topic rather that presenting it at a surface value. I did not truly hone this ability until I took Advanced Placement English in junior and senior year of high school. Previously, I would focus more on my quotes, letting them stand on their own to support my argument. In junior year, my AP English teacher mentioned this in the comments on my first paper of the year. She said that I sometimes relied on "...stacking or listing evidence." She pointed out that I was proficient in choosing and introducing quotes, but my explanations of these quotes were lacking. However, in her comments on my later essays she went on to say I had improved this skill. Regarding my final research paper she wrote "I cannot fault this essay on any major basis." However, I encountered this issue again in my senior year. In an essay on Hamlet I reverted back to simply using quotes to summarize and stand alone rather than utilizing them to further develop my idea. In the paper assigned next, I really focused on this particular skill. In that essay on *The Handmaid's Tale* I took the time realize the purpose of each quote and to express that purpose to the reader through thoughtful explanation. By the end of the year I was much more confident in this skill and my writing in general. My teacher agreed that my writing had improved greatly. Unfortunately, there are still some aspects of my writing I still need to further develop. One of these is my editing. By the time I finish a paper I often forgo in-depth editing. I find it time consuming and dry. Sadly, this can result in small errors making it into my final essay. However, I know thorough editing is essential to create a presentable paper. Going forward I hope to devote more time to close editing. I know this will help me create more polished papers throughout college. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Annelise Mueller ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on my organization skills while writing. I make sure my introduction, body paragraphs and conclusion are organized based on the given task. Staying organized helps me portray my key ideas in the essay; without organization my essays are messy and choppy. In twelfth grade, my AP literature teacher helped me organize my essays. In the beginning of the year, we were assigned two literature pieces followed by two essays. I handed in my first essay last year, we were assigned to analyze *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelly. My teacher told me that my organization needed work; however, if I fixed that then my essay would have been perfect. I started that essay by stating \"[In Mary Shelley's novel, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Frankenstein]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, Victor Frankenstein portrays the characteristics of a tragic hero. His ambition to "explore unknown powers, and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation" led him, and the ones he loved, to grief and suffering.\" I remember that my English teacher\'s template for the paper was somewhat basic for being the first essay; reorganization helped me understand my paper better. \ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Growing as a writer, I want to work on my vocabulary and obtaining strong enough evidence for my paper. I feel like I lack strong transitional vocabulary to use for my body paragraphs. It lacks professionalism, I don\'t know how to transition from topic to topic and I feel as if it makes my paper weak. I fear I won\'t be able to express my ideas to the class. \ (250 words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julia Muller ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I tend to focus on clearly defining the topic I'm discussing early on in the paper. Not only is it important so that an audience with no previous knowledge can understand what is being written about, but it also allows knowledgeable audiences to see my understanding of what the topic is. For example, in a paper on applying IR structural realist theory to North Korea nuclearization, I spent much of the first paragraph explaining what structural realist theory is. I initially focused on its two key ideas of anarchy and power, and then followed up by stating that "the five core assumptions of structural realism are all related to these ideas of anarchy and power," and proceeded to list and thoroughly explain each assumption. The international relations professor that the paper was written for emphasized the importance of defining the theory before attempting to apply it to a political issue. Because of this, I went back to my original paper and instead of merely assuming the audience would know about the theory, I revised it to clearly state and explain the key points of structural realism to better support my paper and assertions. In the future, I'd like to better develop my introduction writing. Currently when writing an introduction, I tend to give a short overview of the topic and then immediately present the thesis, but I'd like to find ways to improve my introductions to make them more engaging and attractive to audiences. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Shantel Mungin ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The thing I focus on most are my main points. Often times when I am writing, it is easy for me to get side tracked. Easy for me to get my thoughts mixed up. This happens more when I am given a task to write but I have to choose the topic (and that is not an easy thing for me to do). When it comes to time for me to begin writing, one writing skills I like to use is to create some kind of outline/planner. Creating an outline if very important for me.

In the last year especially, I have taken action in using my resources to gain guidance in my writing. I tend to do well with organizing my ideas and giving my writing proper structure throughout. I always begin with a proper introduction that solidly establishes my points that I will bring into the writing, followed by great flow into each piece of evidence, new focus, or ending. One example would be an introduction to an idea and piece of evidence in my recent essay; "In the war, the soldiers carried a ton of baggage, physically and emotionally, and every small detail about it counted. O'Brien transforms a painful experience into a work of deep meaning with truth still ringing in fiction]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ (\...) ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[With such large variation, the short story named after the book 'The Things They Carried' demonstrates the exact specifications; 'Depending on numerous factors..."

I had written about "The Things They Carried" by Tim O'Brien and how his experiences in life directly connected to the book even though it wasn't exact accounts of his experience. The excerpt may demonstrate my proper structure and flow, but it also reflects my need to actively improve my tendency to be repetitive. In other words, I do not get to the point quickly and effectively at times. Throughout the essay, the beginning sentence in the example I included is a phrase I tended to state multiple times in different forms. It has been very easy for me to do as I am not great with essay length and this was an eight page essay, so it is simple to spot out when reading everything. It will be increasingly important for me to focus making every aspect of my writing more unique carrying on in the future. I am hoping to carry on with good structure or flow in my writing but I especially need to focus on improving on my repetitive ideas and more in the near future this year. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jonathan Murtha ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When revising drafts for an essay or writing piece I have been working on, I tend to focus on making sure that I have clearly stated the topic of whatever piece I am working on and sticking with that topic throughout the paragraph, while also finding ways to incorporate it into the rest of the writing piece. This skill is important because it allows me to focus on describing one subject and allowing me to explain it in greater detail while also making sure that the subject is relevant to the rest of the writing piece. My English teachers in high school helped raise my awareness of this skill, and have helped me develop it. Whenever I would write an essay or another writing piece, I would first structure out the topics of each paragraph on a separate sheet of paper, and then I would start writing and I would make sure that I stuck to the guide that I made. This helped me to keep focused when writing an essay and make sure it was structured the way I wanted it to be. I greatly enjoy learning about writing skills as they are not only very important to learn, but also very helpful for all types of writing.\ One of the areas of writing that I still struggle in is beginning a piece or writing an introduction or the first sentences of a writing piece. Sometimes, I feel like I can't come up with a good starting sentence or paragraph, and that can bog down my thinking about the rest of the piece and cause me to spend more time on the introduction. I believe that if I write more often and practice introductions, that would help me overcome the hurdle of writing introductions. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Diana Musco ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I focus on trying to make my text as precise and detailed as possible. This is important because it will allow the readers to have a better understanding of your ideas in which you were trying to convey in the text, as a whole. This is especially significant for my final Extended Essay (EE) for my International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program in high school. We were given an instructional session in my Business class in order to use the proper format during our paper. Having a template or outline, especially for a paper with such length, is important because it helped me plan out and organize all of my ideas prior to officially writing my essay. In addition, it helped me organize my thoughts in a clear and precise manner and arrange the information into a well-thought out text. The librarian showed us how to successfully follow an EE outline. He was able to guide my paper in a direction that supported my claim, and gave me suggestions on how to develop my writing. Furthermore, he showed us how to follow a template for the title page and table of contents, which made my paper easier to follow, as well as looking more professional. The title page, for example, had to incorporate my research statement, "Liberty Travel's response to the increased popularity of Expedia", research question, "How should the travel agency Liberty Travel respond to the increased popularity of the travel website Expedia?", IB subject, "Business and Management, and the word count, "Word Count: 3999". The librarian was able to instruct my classmates and I on successfully creating this title page using his template. In the future, I hope to improve on my long research papers by gathering all or most of my information beforehand, and then figuring out where to place it. Although I can come to know that outlines are a pivotal part in any writing process, often times I find research towards the end that would make a very strong argument, but have difficulty placing it and adding on to my already existing information. I have to learn to spend multiple sessions researching before I begin to write my paper so it can be as cohesive as possible, without scattered information. After doing so, I can follow an outline or template to write my paper. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Skyler Nagpaul ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Skyler Nagpaul I have found in my writing I tend to focus on how my writing piece begins, mostly in the introduction. I feel I do this because no matter how different my teachers expectations are all of them want a simple but strong introduction. I agree with how important the introduction is to any essay. If you don't grab your reader's attention in the very beginning of your piece, chances are that they aren't going to take the time to finish it. I confidently believe that I can make a reader interested in my writing. In the past I have had to write essays about American history and how sometimes, as great as our country might be, we don't follow our own constitution that we created during times of war. Now this topic is hard to explain to any group of people, but especially to uninformed, patriotic, citizens. My approach to this essay was to ask the reader a rhetorical question on how they would feel if they lived in a country where the government didn't even follow its own rules. Following up this question I explained in a non-offensive way that it might shock and surprise people that they do. This way it leaves the reader wanting to learn and educate themselves. Moving on as a further my education I would like to improve my word choice and the rhythm of my body paragraphs. I feel as if my writing would benefit with a larger vocabulary. I also feel that having a wide rounded vocabulary helps writers reach different groups of people. What will also help my writing reach more people is the rhythm in my body paragraphs. I tend to struggle trying to keep the same energy I have in my introduction throughout the whole piece. I am excited to improve these two aspects of writing. I believe it will help enhance my pieces and reach a larger group of people. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kieran Nanavati ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Kieran Nanavati\ Self-Reflection \#1\ When I am writing, something that I have been focusing on is using the correct punctuation within a sentence. I have always been very generous with the use of commas in my writing- throwing them in wherever and whenever I could. Throughout high school when a teacher would look over or grade my work there would always be crossed out commas. Teachers would tell me that too many commas can make a sentence choppy and hard to understand which is not what you, the writer, want for the reader. After hearing this feedback, I have been working on limiting their frequency. For example, instead of saying "Leading up to the year 1861, the North and South, were divided by views on slavery, which eventually led to the Civil War, that lasted until April of 1865." I might say "Leading up to the year 1861, the North and South were divided by views on slavery. This eventually led to the Civil War, that lasted until April of 1865." By removing some of the commas and turning the one sentence into two, it flows much better and is easier for the reader to understand.\ An aspect of writing I want to work on and develop while at Geneseo is my ability to respond to or analyze evidence. Most of the time it is easy for me to pick out evidence from a reading, but what is lacking is what comes next- the response. I am often afraid to summarize too much, and because of this my writing lacks depth. I would like to become better at this because I think it will help my writing skills grow a great deal. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Madeline Naschke ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As I revise papers and essays that I write, I most often focus on avoiding excessive repetition in my descriptions and analysis. I tend to repeat myself in my writing; I will sometimes state the same idea twice simply with different wording. This bad habit is usually a result of my attempts to emphasize a point or to paint a more vivid picture of whatever I am describing. However, rather than enriching my writing, it more often detracts from its quality and makes it come across as padded and long-winded. An excellent example of my proclivity for unnecessary repetition can be found in an early draft of my Personal Statement for college applications. While initially describing something that I found boring in music class in the fourth grade, I stated, "I liked history, but the topic of Beethoven seemed stale and tiresome. I could not have imagined a more dry, dull topic on which to spend weeks and weeks, nor could I have envisioned a more bland lecture to have to sit through every day in class". After revisions, I had cut this lengthy, repetitive statement down to "I liked history, but the topic of Beethoven seemed state and tiresome". I am usually able to catch such (admittedly frequent) flaws while independently revising and editing drafts of my papers; therefore, I have not received much direct feedback or guidance concerning this aspect of my writing. However, my writing has been continually criticized by my teachers and peers alike for being too wordy and too long-winded. This is the aspect of my writing that is my main focus when revising drafts of papers. In addition to this aspect, during my time at Geneseo (and beyond) I would like to further develop my skills in wording, phrasing and sentence structure. I sometimes struggle with effectively putting my thoughts into words; I can't decide which word to use, I can't think of a good way to construct a certain idea on paper, or I struggle with run-on sentences. These uncertainties arise in everything I write: papers, essays, letters, even emails. As I continue to develop my writing and critical thinking skills at Geneseo, I hope to become more comfortable in putting my ideas into words and expressing exactly what I intended to express to my readers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Meaghan Nash ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of writing I already make a point of focusing on is having a clear and precise thesis statement in my introduction paragraphs. This skill is important because it outlines what I will be explaining throughout the rest of my essay. It is important that the thesis statement is relevant to the topic and to what I will be describing and analyzing. This has been a skill I have worked on throughout high school, and my eleventh-grade teacher helped me develop this better. She helped me to practice by writing thesis statements based on passages we had read in class. Additionally, she taught me to use parallel structure when writing thesis statements because it's clearer for the reader and improves the sentence structure. One example of a thesis statement I wrote recently from my School of Education application states, "I believe I was successful in school because of the wonderful teachers I had who were patient, understanding, and adaptable to the ways I wanted to learn". Before this, I would constantly struggle with writing a thesis and it was one of my weakest elements of my essays. Now I am more certain with my ability of this important writing skill. As I continue throughout college and this course, I acknowledge that there are writing skills I need to improve on. One would be my analyzation of direct quotes or evidence from the text. While I am good at finding information that will strengthen my argument, I am not so confident in how to explain it without basically reverberating the quote I cited. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Connor Nelson =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Self Reflection Essay \#1\ Throughout high school, it progressively felt easier to write essays for my English classes. There was one assignment in specific that I still look back on to this day as a reference to check if I hit all the points in my essay. It was a life studies essay on Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon.inc, that the teacher said I had one of the best-written essays in all of her classes. After hearing that, I like looking back on how I formatted and laid out that essay in specific. For example, the whole essay I kept the point of view in the third-person by saying words such as he, him, and his. Before I even start writing an essay now I ask myself what and who I am writing about. This helps me tremendously so I don't have to worry about if I did it wrong or right anymore, that was something I messed up on frequently. When introducing and concluding my essay I would present a good hook that would entice the reader to want to read what I wrote. In that essay on Jeff Bezos I wrote one, "the world of eCommerce is slowly being taken over by a monopolistic company, that no one wants to step in front of." That made me stronger as a writer when someone complimented me on my cliffhanger introduction that made the reader not want to stop reading.\ Aside from having a good template to look back on I still make careless mistakes frequently. I need to work on structure and sentence flow here at Geneseo. Many times I get my assignment back and am shocked to see a lower grade than expected. It is rarely about grammar or word choice, it is mostly about choppy and not fully written out thoughts. Also when doing a book report I feel that I use too many quotes straight from the text. Once put in the quotation marks its not my sentence anymore, and I would like to work on reading the text and coming up with my own sentences. Instead of pulling quotes straight from the chapter I just read. More and more practice will help me out with those minor errors. Hopefully, the next four years at Geneseo can help me on that throughout my INTD classes. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Amanda Neri ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I find that while I am writing I focus more on the format of the response. For example, when writing an essay, I always go over in my head the steps I need for a good essay. In middle school I learned how to apply this skill to make a good essay which really helps me write my essays. I always make sure there is a topic sentence to introduce what I am about to write. For example, when I was writing my essay for the education program here in Geneseo I started off with, "I would like to describe why I want to be a teacher. My desire to become a teacher began back while I was still elementary school." Using that sentence as my topic sentence just states what I am going to talk about in the essay. When stating quotes, I learned to briefly go over what I am about to state before I write the quote. After the quote is written I was taught to once again sum what the quote means but tie it to more of the concept of the topic I am writing about. From there I go on to transitioning to each quote doing the same process until I am ready to close the paragraph. When closing the paragraph, I always make sure to end with a conclusion paragraph or sentence. When it was time to conclude the essay my conclusion sentence was "Whenever there are strengths there are always challenges, to me I think a challenge to me would be worrying about whether or not my lesson is actually engaging the kids, and worrying about if I actually am doing the job right." The conclusion sentence was always the sentence that shows the reader that the essay is over so having a strong conclusion sentence makes the essay strong. Even though I have a few strengths while writing I know I have my downfalls which is always grammar and the vocabulary that I use. I know that it's not the best especially when I am writing an important paper. I would like to focus on worrying more on the grammar when it's needed and to make sure that I also strengthen my vocabulary with words from the thesaurus. I know when my weaknesses become strengths, I will be more confident in my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gabrielle Neubert =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I have always consciously focused on using explicit, descriptive words in my writing. I consistently reread and review all my writing to implement adjectives and adverbs and other descriptive phrases when necessary. This has become a time-consuming process throughout my entire writing process, but I believe it is completely necessary to use descriptive words in order to make writing, especially academic writing, more vibrant and satisfying to read. It's also imperative that I know how to use these words with proper formality and definition since the writing is academic and formal in nature. Throughout high school, my English teacher worked diligently to give us, her students, weekly writing prompts that were peer edited and reviewed. I think this really helped me gain a perspective on what good writing contained. One aspect I lacked in my writing was descriptiveness and my peers and teacher guided me to work with my writing and revise in a way to sound much more professional. I focused most of my attention on using this new skill in my research papers. I once wrote a research paper dedicated to discussing child prodigies and their effects on society. For example, I would often leave my sentences bland and choppy, with little flow like "Child prodigies are special. They are still normal children." I can now enhance the aesthetic of that sentence to "Child prodigies are unsurprisingly special in their own individual uniqueness; however, they are still normal children who act very similar to other children their age." In the future, I plan to continue to work on the flow of my work as well as shortening the amount of time spent on revising my vocabulary since I could spend much needed time elsewhere in revising my work like using transitional vocabulary instead of descriptive vocabulary. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mai Nguyen-Jeanneret ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} A writing skill that I consider myself good at, is constructing my own view. I think that this skill is important in writing, because it shows that I, as the writer and researcher, not only understand the topic being prompted or suggested, but also understand that there is a deeper meaning to the text and have my own thoughts of the topic. I cultured this understanding of this skill through my environmental science class. We wrote short current article papers about a topic relevant to the class topic. Within these papers, we wrote a summary of the article we read, the bias of the author and then our own bias. Through these exercises, I learned to decipher the difference between not only how the author might see the topic at hand, but how my opinion of the topic was either positively or negatively swayed by the author or compare it to my own pre-thought beliefs of the topic. In the beginning of the class, I had a hard time constructing my own idea without thinking any further than the article I had read, and I left my bias looking vague and confusing to understand. By the end of the year, I was able to construct my own ideas, not only looking at the author's opinion, and sometimes explicit biased view, but also investigate my prior beliefs and learnings through other sources. By constructing my own view, it forces me to look beyond just the one source that may be explicitly asked to look at but think further into my own mind. Not only did this skill help me in environmental class, but in my AP Lit class, for writing my book report. I was able to construct my own views of the book into the varied opinions and understandings of the book by literary critics. I am not one to remember particular writings or ideas that I have done in the past, so I can't really give you precise evidence of my growth. A skill that I would like to grow through this course is my style of writing. I think, and the teachers who have graded my work, that my style is very awkward. My writing is a combination of bad grammar and a mix of my own speech (the way I might talk to a friend) and writing to someone important. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kristina Nicholaysen ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of writing I heavily focused on is getting to the point in essays. ]{data-contrast="auto"}[This skill is extremely important for any piece of writing.

Often I would find myself using more words than necessary to try and get my point across. It would make my writing sound repetitive and made it awkward to read. Ms. Gallehugh, my english teacher in my senior year, and I were able to break this habit by learning to be more concise with my writing. This happened many times during my writing and I worked to fix it but it always seemed to leak through the cracks. An example of this in a piece of writing of mine would be from a paper in which I discussed the symbolism of pomegranates in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Kite Runner. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[In this paper I stated, "The boys viewed this pomegranate tree as a sacredly holy place where they could run away from their problems."

The purpose of a thesis statement is to inform the reader about the main topic of the essay. In my writing I ensure that I have a strong thesis because it sets the tone for the rest of the essay. If I have a strong and clear thesis statement, the reader will want to continue to read the essay. However, if the thesis statement is weak and inexplicit it might confuse the reader and cause them to become uninterested in the essay. I believe that I have been able to develop a strong thesis in my academic writing due to the strategies and emphasis of thesis statements that my eleventh grade high school english teacher taught me. My teacher taught me the importance of having a strong thesis statement and how it can grab the reader's attention. For example, when writing an essay on a topic such as global warming and the effect on Antarctica, I needed a strong thesis in order to interest the reader. An example of a weak and unclear thesis statement could be, "Global warming is affecting many different places in the world." This is a weak statement because it is boring and very unclear on where these effects are taking place. However with a thesis statement such as, "For the past decade, there has been a rise in global temperatures which has caused ice sheets to rapidly melt. This rapid ice loss has caused many issues in Antarctica." This is a strong thesis because it is an interesting statement and it explains to the reader what global warming is causing and where the negative effects are occurring. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ One weakness that I have when writing that I would like to work on is I tend to be redundant. Instead of repeating the same words over and over again, I need to focus on how to rewrite ideas in different ways in order for my writing to be less repetitive. I could try to be less redundant by taking ideas and practicing how to define them differently without using the same exact words the original idea used. If I could fix this weakness I think my level of writing would significantly improve. Overall, learning new writing skills makes my writing more sophisticated and interesting to the reader. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Allison North =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One skill that I focus on in my writing is organization because I want my writing to flow nicely and for my ideas to be presented in an order that makes them understandable. If my ideas are scattered and unorganized then they will not be conveyed to my reader correctly. The whole point I am trying to make becomes lost if my writing does not flow logically. I used to have trouble staying organized and would go back and forth between ideas. My twelfth grade English teacher helped me fix this issue. He talked a lot about the importance of organization, and he would have us create an outline for each paper we wrote. In the outline, we would lay out a few main claims and two or three sub claims. This would help us organize our thoughts before we started writing. For example, in an essay I wrote in eleventh grade about [Great Expectations]{.underline}, I did not outline, so my ideas were split up and my essay was overall very disordered. However, in the final paper I wrote last year, I outlined my ideas and planned what I was going to write. My paper was about [Pride and Prejudice]{.underline} and for my outline, I wrote my thesis ("the author presents a commentary on the status of women in society by portraying three different views of marriage") and three claims, each about a different marriage in the novel (Charlotte and Mr. Collins, Lydia and Wickham, and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy). The thesis became my introductory paragraph, each claim became a body paragraph, and the sub claims I wrote for each claim were the main points I discussed in each body paragraph. Creating an outline helped me keep my thoughts organized and led to a well written essay. One aspect of writing that I would like to develop is not repeating my ideas. Although I have learned to organize my writing, I still find that I over-explain things and repeat the same idea over and over again, just in different ways. I would like to learn how to condense my writing so that each sentence is meaningful and contains a different idea. I feel the need to write a lot, and I need to realize that with writing, quality is better than quantity. I think one way to achieve this is to carefully read over my writing and condense any ideas that feel repetitive. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nick Nugent ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I attempt to take ordinary, dry sentences and turn them into much more sophisticated statements and arguments as I revise my work. Often times I find that I have settled for rather boring statements which loses the attention of the reader. The reader does not want to read bland statements but rather statements that engage their minds. I try to emphasize this writing skill in my revisions of my work. This allows the reader to actually take away something significant from my work. Additionally, it adds to the overall enjoyment of the piece for the reader. In persuasive pieces, bland sentences do not fully express my points of argument. Developing deeper meanings and thoughts in these sentences adds so much more to the point of argument. My senior year English teacher emphasized the importance of this writing skill as he revised my final portfolio. I remember how he underlined a sentence where I was trying to stress my gratitude for my high school. He told me that some of the sincerity was lost along the way in the superficial sentences I had constructed. I revised a particular sentence where I simply stated my eventual gratitude for the school through my years. With the help of my teacher, I managed to turn that sentence into something more meaningful as I gave an actual example of my gratitude accumulating through the years. I was grateful to have learned a new skill to employ in my writing. Learning and practicing new writing skills certainly adds to the quality of my work. I could certainly try to expand my word choice to further augment the sincerity and complexity of my sentences in my work. I also think that I must be careful in selecting "bigger" words as sometimes I think it fits what I mean to say but it really does not. Additionally, I must work on my overall organization in my writing so there is no confusion for the reader. Lack of organization allows for my evidence and thoughts to lose value and persuasion. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mildred Nyarko ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing I tend to always make sure each body paragraph connects to my introduction paragraph. I do this by introducing one important note I want audience to take aways from my essay and always bring attention towards that idea at the end of each body paragraph. My reasoning for this is because in every essay there is a message the writer wants to send to the audience. If there is no message in a writing then its not meaningful. Giving a constant reminder to the audience about the message of the essay is a good way to hold on to their attention. This technique was taught to me early highschool, when my teacher made it a requirement that we as writers always make sure to refer back to our introduction paragraph when closing out each paragraph. This better helped me with my writing because I now make sure to bring attention back to what I introduce to the audience for them to gain a better understanding of the idea I am trying to share with them. For example, instead of saying " This quote shows the 1800s changed because of societal movements." I say "This proves the significance of the idea that in order to encourage people to make changes in the society you have to give them a reason to. Many societal movements focused on connecting with their audience whether it was through religion, ideas or experiences. This goes back to the idea that God was the biggest asset used during the 1800s to motivate people into changing society at the time". In my introduction, paragraph I talked heavily about how God was used at the time so I made sure to mention it again.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One concept I struggle heavily with is being able to sum up everything I wrote from all of my body paragraphs into a conclusion. I tend to include too much information or not at all. I don't know where the perfect balance is and it does jot end mt essays off strong.

Having organized and well planned work also helps me ensure that all points of the assignment are being covered. If I don't plan out my writing before I put it on paper, or often times type it, I tend to get off track. However, when I take the time to systemize my work, I usually have more success. My tenth grade English class for example, mostly focused on argumentative writing. Throughout the course, I constructed several essays on different topics, one of them being whether or not immigration should be illegal. I remember very clearly that the majority of the feedback that I received for that assignment was in regard to the organization of the piece. Especially in argumentative writing, it is important to follow the format and start out by stating the claim. However, I didn't follow the recommended structure and I went straight to giving evidence on the topic without previously stating a counterclaim, or any background information. In this specific essay, I started out by saying "Immigration to the United States has become a huge problem throughout time. Of course immigration is a widespread topic throughout the world, but illegal immigration is what causes the most controversy. I believe that immigration has a negative impact on our country and should be severely controlled or even stopped." My English teacher recommended that I use a template from the textbook "They say, I Say," which we are using in my writing seminar course as well. Instead of starting off the argument with what I believe, my teacher suggested that I start off by stating what others say, and then supporting my thesis. After receiving this advice, I reworked my thesis and stated, "When it comes to the topic of immigration, most of us will readily agree that it is a widespread topic and problem in many parts of the world. Where this agreement usually ends, immigration has a negative impact on the United States and should be more secure and controlled. However, some are convinced that the effects of immigration contribute to the prosperity of our country." After stating the counterclaim, I then supported my argument. ::: ::: {style=";"} \ ::: ::: {style=";"} Moving forward, I'd like to focus on ensuring that my writing stays organized, is well structured, and covers all aspects of the assignment. Instead of just planning out my ideas on paper, I could try using different types of graphic organizers and other similar methods of organization such as templates. This way, I have a clear and well constructed idea of what I am going to write before I even start. I would also like to focus on supporting my writing with evidence. Often times, I find it challenging to find useful textual evidence and incorporate it into my own work. Working on assignments that require using evidence and citations would help me strengthen these skills. ::: <div> \ </div> ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lora Odeh ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} look for many different aspects of academic writing when I proofread my writing. I have been focusing on if my writing is organized or not, I tend to go all over the place while writing and sometimes go off-topic. The organization of an essay is very important in your paper because it makes your paper easier to read and more understandable. This skill was always so important during English my teacher would always make sure that we had our papers organized. This skill had made it so much easier for me to write an essay. For example, I wrote " Holden Caulfield became depressed after he lost his younger brother Allie and is now scared to transition to adulthood. " I would then have to change it to make it easier to read. I would change it too " In "Catcher in the Rye" the main character Holden Caulfield has had so many bad childhood memories that he has a fear of becoming an adult.". One aspect that I want to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo and beyond is making better thesis statements. I have always had trouble with making them because every teacher I had in High School would teach us a different way. The teachers I had would say that the way I was taught was incorrect and then would show me a different way. It got so confusing that every time I would make one I would not know if it was good or not.

The advice my aunt has given me always sits in the back of my head when I'm writing and encourages me to take a second look at my words and sentences and change them in ways that advances my writing. An example would be changing my thoughts "It was a Monday morning, and I was walking down the street" to "It was a beautiful Monday morning, the sun was shining on my face as I was walking down the street". As this school year I hope to continue working on this skill and to just become a better writer. There are other aspects of my writing that I would also like to work on. Including learning how to use quotes the proper way, learning how to organize my writing, and learning how to write a better thesis. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kiran O\'Sullivan-Bakshi ====================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I plan on developing my writing skills to achieve better argument flow and relevant transitions. I have struggled writing argumentative essays due to difficulties in organizing what my essay should address. My writing seems to make things so concise I have issues reaching word minimums without adding trivial digressions. I have taken several writing-intensive classes including humanities and Islamic World history. I feel that I have been complimented by my professors on my verbal argument skills in class but fail to achieve similar appraisals in written assignments. When developing my essays, my hypothesis is usually changed multiple times to add more content or shift the foundations of my argument due to discrepancies between my body paragraph and introduction. I would start my paragraph something like this, "Islam was an early progressive movement characterized by public welfare and stability..." I would be forced to adjust it to encompass a more general argument. "Islam was an early progressive movement which expanded and adapted to different cultures, encouraging trade, etc...". My most common critique is the lack of consistency between my opening and body paragraphs. My Islamic History Professor made it apparent that I had to combat this weakness through her analyses of my essays. She would highlight the fact that there were too many arguments that did not have enough of a relationship or overlap to justify including them simultaneously. Though, I felt that if I stuck to an organized outline based around an explicit point, I would inevitably fall short on content requirements. This is why I want to focus on being able to further develop relevant aspects of my argument without being redundant or having a poor flow. When in the process of writing long assignments it may take me an hour to write out small additions due to anxiety or writers\' block even when the assignment provides a clear objective. I am hoping this class helps me organize my thoughts and outlines better so I am better equipped to deal with long and highly specialized discussions. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ronan O\'Toole ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When comprising an essay I focus on making a strong introduction. I feel like personally the introduction of the essay can carry the rest of your essay if it's good enough. Starting an essay off strong and catching the reader\'s attention will make them more intrigued going through the rest of the essay, this is what I learned from my high school english 11 teacher. I would usually start off with a couple ideas and write it down initially, like saying "include link between the smell of town and sulfur mine burning down," then come back to one idea to spread on it further, revising it to say something like "many townsfolk remembered the distinct smell of that day looking back trying not to cringe at reimagining it again." Finally before finishing off the introduction, my teacher from 10th grade taught me how to smoothly transition into the coming paragraph to make a more coherent essay, so I would transition it into the next body paragraph by briefly connecting what was said all throughout my introduction to what is going to be said in the coming paragraphs. An example of this would be me saying "The living situation in that town only worsened with the sulfur mine accident, because now they didn't only have to worry about the smell they had to worry about their jobs."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue my education at Geneseo I would like to work on my time management when writing essays and short responses. I find myself having trouble finishing the assignment on time because I try and go too in depth or overthink my writing all together. So when constricted to a certain time period to complete something, I wind up rushing through the last half of it to finish it while the first half is usually much stronger.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joseph Ozello =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [My writing has been a problem for as long as I could remember. My brain can not wrap around the idea of grammar and punctuation. Ever since 3rd grade I wrote my first essay about something that makes me happy and I chose to write about science. I love science and I remember writing about me wanting to become a doctor. After this assignment I got it back and I realized that I didn't get a grade as high as my peers. It really started to sink in that I need help with my writing. I was put in extra help english classes that were supposed to help me with my writing skills. I could see that these classes were not helping me.There needed to be a change, so I went to my teachers extra help whenever I could and it helped for the time being. I would ask my teacher to go over the topics of grammar and punctuation because these were the subjects of writing that I just didn't understand. For example I would be writing a sentence for an essay and I would not know if it was necessary to put a comma or not. The breakthrough point was in 11th grade I had one of the best english teachers oh my highschool career her name was Mrs.Bottan she helped me understand the different methods of punctuation and grammar through a research paper that I wrote at the end of the year for my final project I wrote about a woman named Katie and she made a crop company to sell goods to the less fortunate.Mrs.Bottan helped me through the process of paper to show me the correct way to format and brainstorm the paper.

Writing a better thesis statement will help be write more effectively at a college level. The thesis statement is key to any essay because it states your topic, lets the reader know what they are going to read, and establishes why this essay is important and should be read. Without a strong thesis, your essay can seem to lack focus and stray off course. I was made aware that this kill was lacking during the AOP summer program, when my professor pointed it out to me. She then gave me tips such as \"making it longer, include details but just enough to hook the reader, show enthusiasm and why it is important.\" An example would be when I wrote my research paper during the AOP summer program. My paper began with the thesis statement \"School safety is more important after shootings.\" This is when my teacher told me her tips which transformed my thesis into \"The growing rate of these school shootings, has proved that a change has to be in the high school security system to ensure more safety for the students.\" With thesis statements like this and following the template given to me I believe I can write a better thesis. Before I believed that I was too scared to write too much in my thesis believing it would give up my entire essay, but learning these new skills has showed me the way to writing a more concise paper. The thesis statement is one of the most important skills a writer needs. For me my writing skill is developing a good thesis, something I lacked before entering college. With a better thesis I believe it can help me write better at a college level. Also one aspect i want to develop fact for my time at Geneseo is researching the proper ,material for writing. I often would pick entrust worthy article that have no definitive proof and are not academic. Focusing on my research skills can help me write academic papers that are backed by the facts. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexa Parry ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I believe that my strong suit in the papers I have written in the past was the development of their structure. The ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[insurance that my work clearly and effectively illustrates its content gives reassurance that I\'m on the right track. The structure of any piece is a crucial part of writing because that is what ties all your ideas together in an organized fashion. My focus in writing is establishing a smooth transition linking the similar points together. Ensuring that related sections in my body paragraphs are linked together to help explain the main message; and that the ideas and arguments progress in an orderly manner. I took another route on my assignment that my professor gave and used this structure in one of my English writing pieces this year by proactively expressing my ideas and broadening it. That assignment made me proactively state my point, give background and evidence, while staying on task. For example, I gave the explanation of why my subject was important "Conversing over writing can help broaden your understanding and help you see different points of views that connect to a similar idea." Then I began to expand my thought on how it affects others " The natural flow dismisses selected prompts that block your feelings and emotions that should be placed in such writing".]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I advance, I'd like to direct more attention on my conclusion portion in my essays. I feel as though I never fully summarize my point and just end it vaguely .

I like to make sure that I am sounding professional. This skill is important to ensure that my writing, whether it is an essay or an email to a professor, is taken seriously and is a writing piece that I can be proud of. I would not say that I have perfected this skill but it something that I try to improve on in every essay. One example I can provide could be taken from this reflection. I start with a thought that sounds something like "It is important to make sure I sound like an educated, professional college student". This initial thought is just the base for crafting a sentence that sounds the way I want it to sound, professional and educated. This thought turned into my third sentence "This skill is important to ensure that my writing, whether it is an essay or an email to a professor, is taken seriously and is a writing piece that I can be proud of". It is important in academic writing that sentences do not sound too conversational, like you're talking to a friend. In some forms of creative and other types of writing it might be okay, but it is probably best to avoid that in more academic writing. This skill is one that my English teachers would give me pointers on, and eventually would shape how I prefer to academically write today. This skill was also shaped by my Father giving me advice on how to write an email to a teacher or someone else of importance. Although this is something I constantly focus on in my writing, and got much feedback about, it is a skill that I believe I can improve on immensely. In the future, a skill that I would like to focus on more and improve is making connections in my writing. One aspect that I struggle with is presenting all of the facts that I need to, but then not connecting them to the main focus of the essay or not explaining why that information is important. I feel like making connections is important in most academic writing because it helps the reader to understand your thought process and to better understand the purpose of the whole essay. It is definitely something that I feel needs work, it is something that I hope to improve at Geneseo. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mark Pav ====================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Mark Pav ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [Writing has never really been one of my strengths throughout school. Over the years I have progressively started to focus on some of my weaknesses to improve my skills. When I write/revise my main focus is words spelled correct and punctuation in the appropriate spots. This allows the reader to keep up with what i am saying so it makes sense. Using these strategies also goes a long way to prevent other things from happening like run on sentences. So before focusing on my writing my sentences would sound like this: " I love to play basketball it is fun I really like to play when my dad gets home from work.\'\' We can all tell this is not a strong sentence. Now with me realizing this I take a different approach on it. It sounds something like this now: "I enjoy playing basketball with my dad, but I have to wait till he gets home from work." This sounds a lot better and just goes with the flow. I have been in reading class from k-8th grade. I had this one teacher throughout most of my elementary school who I will never forget. Even going back a couple of years after I tested out of reading she still had a huge impact on me as a writer. She brought me back to the basics and told me to focus on punctuation because then everything else will fall into place. Till this day we still stay in touch and she is still amazed how far I have come in this process.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [With this being said I still am not a great writer. I am aware of the areas I need to focus which is enhanced vocabulary and better grammar. I already know sometimes what I am trying to say just does not come out write and I don\'t know how to properly rewrite it. Using advanced vocabulary would also make my essay just flow better as a whole. Even though I have a couple of strengths I have more flaws that I am aware of and plan on working hard to improve my writing skills as a whole.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Airiel Pearlman ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I tend to focus on sentence structure, more specifically keeping parallel structure in lengthy sentences. I took AP Lang and AP Literature in high school, and my teacher always drilled us on keeping parallel structure in sentences while discussing complex subject matter. Sentence structure is a key aspect for the audience to understand. If an academic paper or scientific report is lacking sentence structure, it can become rather confusing for the reader to understand what the writer is attempting to convey. This can be just as important, even more important if the subject matter is a persuasive essay. When it is a persuasive essay sentence structure can lack meaning and depth to convey the writer\'s intention and evidence, so it does not come across as sloppy or messy. A recent example from my own academic writing is from a term paper I had to write that was quite lengthy, detailing the shift in contemporary art from the last thirty years. AT one point I say *\"[Within the art community, many were divided as to where they should show their art, how they should offer support to those like KwieKulik who performed resistance pieces (as exemplified by "The Monument Without a Passport").\"]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ Here I keep parallel structure in the sentence, but I could also break up the sentence by using any FANBOYS. This way the sentence would read more cohesive and fluidly, while still getting my point across that KwieKulik needed support for their art, but did not where to show their art. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [This semester I would like to improve my organization when it comes to giving evidence for my thesis. Something I have always struggled with in the past was adequately showing the reader my intentions while still keeping in line with my thesis. I often stray away from my thesis and then must revise it to convey where my evidence has lead me, based on a literature prompt. I find it difficult to write within the guidelines and constrictions placed before for a specific assignment and I would like to improve that this semester. Perhaps I could do an extensive outline that would allow me to revise my thesis as I write it and change it, and further develop my thesis and evidence. This way the hard part would be done for me (organizing my essay) and I would only have to focus on grammatical improvements for the essay.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Maya Pellitteri ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Maya Pellitteri ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [5 September 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Self Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When I write, I pay the most attention to the message of my writing. I use descriptive words to make the sentence flow. In my college application essay, I wrote about how dance has impacted my life. In the first draft of my introduction I wrote "dance became an essential part of my life and could bring me deep into the emotion of the moment", but then changed the sentence to " I fall into a warm and quiet place when I dance; immersed in the music and energy, where everything else is far in the distance." The second sentence is much more engaging and personal. My goal is for the reader to be able to experience the words as they read them and get sucked into the piece. I am lucky to have had a passionate English teacher who encouraged creativity. He gave essay topic that forced me to think deeply and experiment with my writing, instead of just writing generic essays. Using description is important because it makes the text more clear and interesting, but it's also important to find a balance because too much description can have the opposite effect. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One writing skill I need to work on is expanding my thoughts. I can say a lot with few words, but then have trouble stretching out the idea. This is especially problematic when I am assigned long essays. Maybe it would help to break apart the idea, then turn each piece into a sentence. I would also like to work on having smooth transitions. I often have two ideas, but then struggle with fading one into the other. Without this skill, my writing can become confusing and detract from the thesis. Throughout college, I hope to improve my writing skills and be able to write dense essays with clarity. Words can be very powerful when they are used correctly. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Perry ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} The skill I focus most on is connecting my own ideas to the text I am citing. Reciting and agreeing are not the same things. In my last writing assignment for school, I used a quote from Zora Neale Hurston saying, \"No, I do not weep at the world. I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.\" My response to the quote was \"She is so passionate about succeeding in life and nothing could stop her from obtaining that success.\" I used my own ideas on the quote to respond to what the author is saying. The wrong thing that I could have said would be \"She does not cry at the world because she is a go-getter\". My 11th grade English teacher taught me the importance of sharing your own voice in your writing, even though in high school they didn\'t follow the \"They say, I say\" protocol. Transitioning into that mindset won\'t be too difficult for me. As it is important to cite where you are getting your information from, It\'s just as important to state your own opinion on that textual evidence. Connection is a key to writing. If the writer connects to the text, then the reader will be able to understand the writer more clearly. This makes it easier to persuade the reader as well, which is the ultimate goal in most essays. Something I\'d really like to improve on in my writing for the future are my transitions between paragraphs. I find it difficult to flow between thoughts and ideas. I often switch ideas without comparing or intertwining it. Finding the flow of your writing is an important skill to have. Without it, the reader will lose interest or even get confused. This skill is a simple fix that I hope I can master quickly. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rebecca Perry =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As I revise my drafts, I focus on viewing my work from a reader\'s perspective to determine if I am effectively getting to the point in my writing. I have a tendency to provide too many details on a subject thinking that the additional background information will help the reader better understand. This could be helpful, but I have discovered that in my writing this can be rather distracting and the reader can lose sight of the main point. My high school english teacher brought it to my attention that my writing needs to be clearer. In other words, I lack the skill of being precise. Being clear cut is important so the reader can stay engaged while gaining an understanding of the writing and is key so your writing can flow well. In my Anthem essay, my teacher noted areas within each paragraph that did not need to be included because it shied away from the main point I was trying to convey. For example, I originally wrote "When Equality secretly talked about the Golden One he made sure he 'dare not speak it above a whisper\' (pg 1, pt 2).\" My teacher noted that I should "avoid summarizing parts of the story and try to get right to the point of the quote.\" The point I was trying to illustrate was that in Equality's society males did not speak about women. It was unnecessary to include that he specifically spoke about the Golden One in order to get my point across. To improve my writing, I have tried to write shorter sentences and avoid using filler words so the main point does not get lost in the shuffle of words. After writing a work, I go through and try to reduce sentences so they're more efficient to the reader.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [At Geneseo, I want to improve on reducing the amount of time it takes me to write a paper while still ensuring that it is written in great quality. I always feel pressured to write while the clock is ticking. It currently takes me way too long to finish a paper. If I learn new skills to write efficiently, I will become a better writer overall.

I sit down in my chair or lay down in my bed and write what pops in my mind about that topic. Which is exactly what I'm doing right now . Of course it has its flaws like when I'm in the middle of a sentence, and I forget how I was supposed to end it. That makes me have to stop writing for a little while which makes writing this take that much longer. Not gonna lie that exact flaw just happened to me writing the sentence before this one. However at the same time even with flaws like that, I will still write the same way. When I write I feel in control, and when I'm thinking about what to write next, I already know what I want to say but I think mostly on whats the best way to say it to get my point across. I think I got my opinion about writing like this from the fact that in my experience in writing, if a person plans what he or she is gonna write about, then what he or she write is not truly getting their opinion on it at that moment. My opinion is that if I do plan it out before, when I\'m writing the essay I already know what I\'m writing. I guess I\'m saying that there\'s no satisfaction doing what you planned. When I did plan out what I was going to write about in the past, when i got the actual writing part it feels like copying and pasting over and over again. Also it's hard to plan out your transitions from one part of the essay to the next. But I feel like this way of writing, which is just sit down and write, really helps with that. When you write like this, it feels like you are talking to a random person who is just a really good listener and never says a word. So sometimes you\'ll end up just writing transitions because your writing the exact words your thinking of that moment. Again even with flaws like that I will still right this way. The only thing I would want to learn is to get better at it. I\'ll learn from my teachers and fellow students and take little things from everything I see to get better at writing like this. I will end up getting better at it overtime if I keep this up. The more essays like this the better. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: AJ Petty ====================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout high school, my writing has tremendously evolved from simplistic cookie-cutter essays to elaborate, well thought out pieces of work. One technique that I often found myself struggling with was writing a concluding paragraph that simply restated the key points of my essay. For example, a sentence in the conclusion of one of my essays was "Another example of a memoir that supports historical representations of the Holocaust was ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Maus]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ by Art Spiegelman." This sentence, along with the whole conclusion, simply reiterated what I had already covered earlier on in my essay. My eleventh grade english teacher helped me to strengthen my conclusions and said that in order to have a strong conclusion, I needed it to be unique. She taught me to not simply summarize my essay, but instead to introduce an outside event that strengthens my argument. One of the essays that I had written was about the book, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Color Purple]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, and my essay was centered around the breaking of gender norms placed upon women during the 1940's. In my conclusion, I stated, "While this novel was written and published in the early twentieth century, the gender norms that existed back then are still prevalent in some countries in the present day. In countries such as Yemen and Pakistan, women abide to extreme constraints that society places on them." This sourcing of a present day event allowed me to strengthen and reiterate my main points in my essay in a more abstract, unique manner. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue to develop as an academic writer, I would like to feel more confident in my punctuation such as comma splices, colons, and semicolons. Often times when I am writing an essay, I am unsure of what punctuation goes where and I often opt to put it in the wrong spot, or not use the correct punctuation at all. I would also like to learn how to form complex sentences with the use of a semi colon. I have used semicolons in the past, however I would like to utilize them in a coherent and sophisticated manner.

The one I use the most, and want to focus on would be my ability of word choice. I say this not only due to the fact that I gave a presentation on it for my class senior year of high school, but also I feel as if I enjoy trying to find synonyms which often just broadens my vocabulary and furthers my word choice. This skill is important because it allows you to keep the reader engaged as opposed to drifting off due to the same repetitive writing. Also if you throw in a word that may not be familiar with a reader it may cause them to think why that word was placed there, and better yet even figure out the definition. This part of my writing has been shaped over time by not only practice, but also it has been affected by the writer Edgar Allen Poe. For example in his poem The Raven Edgar uses his word choice to sway the audience in awe. In the begging lines he says "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary]{style="font-weight: 400;"}['(]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, The Raven Edition). ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Instead of just saying it was a dark night he uses the word choice to create an image in the reader\'s head.

Also I believe this would leave a much better impression on the reader as they first start my paper.

I feel that if I can provide good examples on whatever topic I am writing about, it will be less challenging for me to present a strong argument overall. Throughout high school, as I have had to write various essays based on literature, I made an effort to look for quotes to base my argument around, that supported essay question or topic. This concept was always pushed by my teachers in high school, and in the past, I have lost points for not providing detailed examples. Because of this, I have learned the importance of strong examples and do my best to incorporate them into my work. In one high school essay based on the connections between Shakespeare\'s ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Macbeth]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ and Niccolo Machiavelli's ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Prince,]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ I searched for the best quotes and examples to prove that Macbeth failed to follow the advice Machiavelli gives in his book.

With good articulation, any message being conveyed in a piece of writing carries a great sense of importance and allows people to hear the emotion behind the words of the writer. A paper of mine that does not include any variation in vocabulary, would come across as sophomoric. My frequent mingling with well-spoken friends and classmates has impacted the way I use words in daily talks and when writing a paper. Also, my confidence in being an articulate writer was due to communicating with my eleventh-grade teacher. My eleventh-grade teacher, while in class, never spoke below a college level vocabulary. Thus, it has encouraged me to make clear and consistent claims with words that draws in attention to the main topic. Additionally, my twelfth-grade teacher was very frank, commenting in class that a pet peeve of his was once someone learns of a new word that helps their essay sound more lucid and intelligent, they use that word every single time in their essay; I felt personally what that meant since I would do exactly what he has brought up and since then tried to not do what irritated him. This opened my mind to new things and allowed me to further expand my vocabulary. An exemplary case of this is in my identity paper, I first said, "It is funny how life is cruel but when looked back on, it is nostalgic." Later, I revised it to, "Life essentially has a hilarious way of making moments pack a punch of reality but still have us look back with nostalgia." This embodies a lot of a casual tone and witty humor within this statement. With the right set of word, I am able to bring visual understanding to an audience about how I viewed my life in an almost satirical way. Though, I am proficient in deciding what words I should use to make a sentence flow, I still need to work on being straightforward and content focused. I tend to use my sophisticated vocabulary to mask my inability to give adequate data to support a claim. My lack of data results in a dent in my grade and comments that say to provide more evidence to make my statement true. In time, I will learn how to directly answer the topic question while answering with meaningful words. Combining both the skills I presently have and the skills I will acquire through Geneseo, I will achieve great results to move easily through all of my classes. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Margaret Phipps ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing papers, something that I try to focus on is organization. I find it enhances your argument or theme of the writing when you are able to stay on track with what your introductory paragraph says in the order that you introduced it. I know for a fact that my appreciation for this skill came from high school in my AP Humanities in 11th grade and my 12th grade AP literature teacher. When writing an argumentative essay, you should state the other side of your argument but state your side and make it clear followed by your reasons that you will talk about in your paper. Doing this helps keep you on task while giving you something to come back to as you're writing if you start to drift. For example, If I am writing an essay on the Novel, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Into the Wild]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[" and the prompt is, Was Chris Mccandless a Fool or a Visionary? I would start as follows; In the Novel "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Into the Wild]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[" by Jon Krakauer]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[some believe that Chris Mccandless is visionary for abandoning today's society and attempting to live his life the way humans were supposed to. While this is a valid point, the way he attempted to do it ultimately made him a fool. He had no training to be on his own so he was not equipped to deal with any obstacles, He was so firm on abandoning all modern culture yet he found shelter in a bus which completely undermined his goal. These few sentences clearly sets up my essay by letting the reading know where I stand and what I plan to talk about. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While I am doing this, something in my writing that I could improve on is contextual evidence. I often know what my stand is on an issue but I rely too much on too little when I could be pulling more quotes that back up my argument. If I could pull more evidence and work on explaining the evidence by not just summarizing it but using it to enhance my argument, it would help tremendously in my papers. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Piscani =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ In all honesty I am not entirely sure when I started writing, but only that it has been a constant source of joy in my life. From poems, prose, to anything in between. However this always seems to fade away when I have to write any type of essay for school. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Though the fact that I had to write about something as terribly dull as the Stamp Act, the content of the paper may seem like the main reason for my apprehension that could simply not be farther from the truth. I hated the idea that my writing would be like anyone else\'s so I continued to search for ways for my papers to become more and more enticing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ I did this by over complicating my papers, making a simple essay about the most mundane topics into a complex piece pulling in as many points and pieces of information as I could in order to make it more interesting. For example, in my senior year of high school my AP Literature teacher had the class write an essay comparing a book to its movie adaptation. My simple paper about 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' comparing the adaptations was quickly turned into a twelve page paper about LGBTQ+ culture in the wake of the wake of the Aids crisis. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Though this may not seem like a negative behavior at first glance. In fact I became extremely skilled at researching for papers, finding database after database filled with information and ways to organize the data and quotes I had found. My desktop would be littered with notes sheets, bibliographies, citations pages, and outlines; all color coded neatly and ready for me to use. This made my complex essays easy to write, only there was a stark downside.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ When writing I found myself figuratively backed into a corner as I researched and wrote more and more, the scope of my essays growing out of control. As I came to this realization, my junior year english teacher and mentor sat me down and told me " Imagine taking a picture of a flower, if you zoom out too far it will be lost. But if you go too close, you won't be able to see the full image. You need to find a balance between the two or else no one will ever see it".]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ This advice continues to change the way I think about writing. I hope to develop a more heightened understanding of scope in essay writing as I take this course, making essays easier to manage while writing them. I believe that this would be beneficial as it would help me to increase the quality of my writing as well as my frame of mind during assignments so that i am able to create a more readable, sophisticated style of writing moving into my education here at Geneseo.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sydney Plummer ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [[Sydney Plummer]{.NormalTextRun .SCXW93119678 .BCX4}]{.TextRun .SCXW93119678 .BCX4 lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"} [[One aspect of academic writing that I highly focus on is my vocabulary.

Specifically, in a research paper that I completed my senior year, I had lots of direct quotes that may not have been easy to understand by a reader without a lot of information. For that reason, I focused a lot on how I introduced and explained the quotes. I used my background knowledge to help develop the quotation and statement. I started with a quote: "develop strategies to exploit their weaknesses, \[and\] give them insider market knowledge when it comes to buying and selling" (Marr). However, that doesn't make sense without an introduction and explanation, so I wrote more in depth and came up with: 'Illegally acquiring data on a players health, heartbeat, breathing, and fitness can allow for another team to 'develop strategies to exploit their weaknesses, \[and\] give them insider market knowledge when it comes to buying and selling' (Marr). If this information falls into the wrong hands, careers could be at stake. There needs to be better protection of data to ensure that this can not happen". This is just one example, however I focused on this in many of my papers. In my future here at Geneseo, I think that I need to focus on transitioning between paragraphs to make my writing flow. I hope to learn the most effective way to seamlessly transition between my paragraphs. I have struggled with connecting paragraphs in the past, and my teachers never focused on that. I feel like my paragraphs in a paper often seem very separate, instead of coming together as one paper. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ambrose Pompea ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Ambrose Pompea]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr.Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106:Inventions of College Writing ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I feel like I have mastered or done really well was making sure I have the structure of the writing piece I have. I have been more focused on adding the information in the structure rather than developing the information. While doing argumentative essays in my high school English and government classes, I would plan on where the information would go compared the the subtopics I was talking about. For example, I would be writing about the branches of government and I would include more information about the branches than either adding information about what the essay was asking or not connecting my thoughts throughout the writing piece(s). Even in my emails that I send to my professors and family, I was not thinking about the structure of the email until my senior year of high school, where I really took my time understanding the importance and how to compose an email or write a paper. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I would like to work on while at Geneseo is adding the context in the introduction and conclusion paragraphs. As well as, adding more detail and deeper vocabulary into my essays and emails. I also do not feel like I am bringing my thoughts about the topic back to the main central idea of the passage. After writing the paper, I realized that I had more of my ideas, thoughts and comments in the 3 or more body paragraphs rather than have general statements in my introduction and conclusion paragraphs. I would also like to work on punctuation. I know that I am having a rough time with certain punctuation signs. Although, it takes longer to write emails or even papers, I strive to do my best on getting better on my weaknesses. Before, I would just state my issue or concern to my teacher about the concepts and be done with the email but , now I will be more careful about what I am saying and adding more detail to make sure my idea or concern is clear to my professor. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Although, structure in a writing piece is important.

I make sure to use strong language, and be very straightforward with my points so that whoever is reading my paper has a clear understanding of my views. My twelfth-grade literature teacher taught me how to set up a specific claim and support it by being not only direct with my point, but having a sense of persuasion as well. This technique reminds me of volleyball, where a player will set the ball and another player will spike it. In English terms, you set your claim up to be spiked by your evidence. If your evidence is strong and convincing enough, you will score a point. However, if it is weak, the other team will refute it and send the ball back. An example of what I did originally is, "In Charles Payne's, I've Got The Light of Freedom, Payne uses the organization of small groups within the deep south to show that ordinary people were just as important in the civil rights movements as heroes like Rosa Parks and Dr. King." From what I've learned thus far, it should look something more like this, "In Charles Paynes, I've Got the Light of Freedom, ordinary people, such as Aaron Henry, pushed the limits of racial inequality through the formation of regional organizations, like the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, proving that lesser known people often had just as an important role as heroes like Dr. King during the civil rights movements." I think I can improve my writing by weeding out details or facts that are not very important. I will often do this because I think it adds character and content to my paper, when in reality it hurts it as it deviates and distracts the reader from the claim and central idea. I believe it will not be a very hard problem to fix, as long as I check over my paper a few times and look for these deviations. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Betina Popnikolova ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect that I tend to focus on my academic writing assignment is the use of proper tone. I usually aim at arguing my points in a clear and concise way, while also trying to sound intelligent. Sometimes, however finding the "right" tone, while writing my essays requires a good amount of effort. I have received feedback by my high school teachers and my humanities professor during my freshman year of college on my work, linked to the fact that the "formality" of my essay weakens its strength and my argument doesn't always sound well - researched or expressed in the proper way, because of the tone that I have used. For example: "In his example the philosopher implies the notion that the subject of his interest was way too complex in its character, reaching a spectrum that no ordinary person would have the ability to fully comprehend" or "In his example the philosopher implies that the subject of his interest was way too complicated and could not be understood by an ordinary person". Consequently, I have recently started using sentence structure that makes more sense, by also putting forth an argument and then providing evidence in my own writing, without making the mistake of taking formal for more academic. What is more, direct tone and and simple language turn out to be much more efficient in most of my writing assignments because they also make the essay sound more personal, providing more opportunities of establishing an emotional connection with the reader.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An aspect of my writing skills that I would like to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo is trying to sound more sophisticated in my papers, having the opportunity to show that I truly understand the theme by my active engagement with it. Also, expressing my effort to show that there are multiple layers of meaning in my texts while making both subtle and complex points (while still using the right tone), would make it easy for readers to spot and comprehend them, showing my true effort in relation to being a sophisticated writer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Paul Portman ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing academically, one important aspect I focus on is making sure that my sentences are concise and precise. I make a conscious effort to avoid fluff and keep things succinct and to the point. I want to keep my statements simple and clear as that is often most effective, especially when I am arguing for something in an essay. Trying to overcompensate my writing with needlessly long sentences and overly complicated words only serve to bog down my work and detract from the point being made. This development in my writing ability has been heavily influenced by both my eleventh and twelfth grade teachers, particularly the former whose very motto was "concise and precise." Both taught me the value of keeping my work clear and easy to follow, and essentially proved to me that less is often more. For example, I may sometimes write a sentence such as "Greed can often be the first step down the path of destruction, once it has corrupted the hearts of all those who befall it." With some careful tweaking, I may then correct it with "Greed inevitably corrupts the heart and destroys those who succumb to it." My twelfth grade teacher also taught me to avoid using passive language in most cases, mainly when I am making an argument and need more affirmative language as seen in the previous example. Learning new skills is essential when improving as a writer, and as a person in general. Without learning new things, I would not feel as confident as I do today, nor would I be eager to learn even more skills down the road.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Of course, as with everything, there is always room for improvement. While I am pretty competent and pragmatic in writing a basic argument or essay at this point, my work could use a bit more style and personality. While it is important that I don't let my own personal thoughts or feelings overtake my work, it is also important that I write in a way that hooks people's attention in a positive manner. By injecting some more style through different forms of syntax and clever diction, it lends additional humanity to my work and therefore more power.

If the thesis is not clear, the reader is not sure what you are arguing about. If your thesis is too lengthy, the reader may become bored or confused with your main argument. I am pretty confident that I can accomplish a well written thesis statement by utilizing a chart given by my eleventh grade english teacher. This chart allows you to put down on paper, all of your ideas for the argument essay and helps to formulate a clear and precise thesis. In one section of the chart, you state your stance on the topic, whether you are for or against it, and in another section you list three main points to your argument. In the final section of the chart, you summarize your three main points into one cohesive thesis that is one or two sentences long. This chart encourages me to have three explicit argument points that will make my thesis clear to the reader. I start out with a reason for my thesis and then continue to state my argument.

Without this variation, sentences have the same tone. The writing becomes banal and uninteresting! I learned a great technique back in eighth grade using highlighters: we highlighted each sentence in a different highlighter so you could see the length of each one and focus to create more variation. Then, we highlighted each sentence according to sentence structure. Did the verb come first, the subject, or the object? If there was a lot of repetition there, then we worked to create more diversity. The final product was an engaging paragraph. An easy way to look at is with these four original sentences in one of my old pieces. "As mentioned, the movie is monochrome. However, the technology to make a full color movie was readily available. This gives a more contrasting tone in every shot. The battle between light and dark is clear and purposeful." These sentences are relatively the same length, with the same subject, verb, object. One way I could fix it would be, "As mentioned, the movie is monochrome, although the technology to make a full-color movie was readily available. This gives a more contrasting tone in every shot; the battle between light and dark clear and purposeful." Now the four sentences have become two, leaving room for a shorter sentence after them. It makes for more of a palatable read! In my writing, I notice I often ramble or drift when I should be more concise. I'd like to hone in on the exact message I'm trying to get across which would strengthen my arguments a lot. I don't want unnecessary portions in my writing that would slow down a reader or take away from the important bits. One way to fix this is to do a proper outline, which will not only help to focus on what I want to write about, but will also keep the format organized and understandable. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Erika Powers ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Oftentimes when I construct an essay, I like to write something I myself would be interested in reading.

Of course, I realize that in order to construct good essays, they must be straightforward and to the point, displaying the idea promptly and clearly. Regardless, when it comes time to rework my draft, I manage to slip a few rhetorical devices in order to make my essays more flowery and interesting to read. Metaphor and imagery are often two devices I find myself using, for example, "Though my dreams and aspirations dance around in my head, lurking on the horizon is the dark murky future" comes from an essay I submitted about what I expected from college and beyond. I could've kept it short, and described how I was uncertain of my future in fewer words, but I decided to throw some devices in there to make it easier on the eyes. English teachers in the past have recommended such, and I've taken it to heart.

In high school, my English teacher gave my class a temple on how to write essays. The temple would help me transition from paragraph to paragraph like using " Furthermore", "Therefore", "Also". Theses are the transition words I would use to talk about my next main idea when I\'m writing. Also when writing essays I forget to explain my evidence when I use a quote, I would quote the author and then say " this shows that the author didn\'t know how to explain how he was feeling because of much pain he was in". After writing that sentence I wouldn\'t know what else to say and I would leave that sentence as my ending sentence and finish the paragraph like that. When I should have said was " The author expressing his pain was difficult for him but he knew he wanted to show his friends and family how he was feeling so he would give them number from 1 to 10 of how bad his pain was and that helped them understand a little better and this relates to the claim because the author wanted to give his family some relief of feeling useless". This how I should explain my evidence, I should be able to tie the reasoning and evidence to the claim.

Specifically, I want to touch on a research paper I wrote last year in my political science class on U.S Foreign Policy. The basis is I chose a topic and had to provide a memo to the president on the pros and cons of the issue and how the political elite should tackle it. Through this assignment, I made considerable progress in refining how I include questions in my writing that encourage more consideration and deeper analysis. This skill is important because many will see a problem and a solution and either go with it or go against it, often leaving out key details and potential consequences. From my paper: "[Lastly, if the president does decide to condemn FSG (Frontier Services Group, a private military and security provider) and China for their deal, how does that damage American reputation?]{.underline} Well, you have now brought to light the poor treatment of Muslims under security of an American company, though in China, and you might receive some domestic backlash. *[How long has this been going on? Why did it start in the first place?]{.underline}* The State Department and military forces might not be too pleased when they learn their private counterparts are out damaging their reputation. This does not appear to be avoidable for the president, simply because the issue coming to light will trigger the social masses so fast in this point in time." The various news sources I researched for this paper outlined the problems, but I took it a step further after realizing that without questions the topic does not encourage deep thought and I used the information to facilitate questioning further into the real importance of the topic. This sort of template requested of me that I research a problem, and outline the possible outcomes and choices, which forced me to develop the skill of asking rigorous questions on why the events are happening. Moving forward I would like to take more information I gather from various sources and put it all into questioning like I had to in this paper, without just blindly reading something and accepting the details and outcomes. Why is the information being conveyed the way it is and why might it even be relevant to me in the first place? I believe it's important to question everything, that's certainly one skill college has taught me to focus on and continue to develop so far. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gabrielle Puente ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I focus on creating a strong thesis that shows the readers I know what I am talking about in my essay. I like to organize my ideas before writing my essay, making sure that all the main points of my research are in order.

For my senior research paper, my topic was sexual slavery, talking about the prostitution industry and the human trafficking aspects of it all. My twelfth grade English teacher let us choose a topic we were interested in, and find information from different sources while at the same time creating notecards for these sources. Her creating the notecard assignments, and having us input a strong foundation for the paper helped me succeed. The paper came easy for me, since I felt strongly of the information I had acquired, while also having strong opinions to back the information up. Having sources and creating notecards helped me for future references, it led me to always staying on top of my thesis, not adding unwanted information that is not relevant to the paper. An example of creating an uninteresting thesis such as \"In this essay, the reader will be introduced to the ways of the Mayan culture.\" To creating something more exciting, \"Throughout the duration of this essay, the reader will learn information of the historic Mayan culture, their ways of life, and interesting facts and components of their nature.\" Adding more descriptive terms can entice a reader, and create an interesting essay.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like to shift my writing to be less opinionated, with more information from reliable sources.Although this can be a bad writing habit, I also believe it comes in handy during certain situations in my own writing.

On the days where a draft was due in class, my literature teacher, Ms. Fletcher,[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}would give us a sheet of paper with multiple questions on it in which we had to ask ourselves questions such as "Is your idea being conveyed clearly?" and "Are you backing up your point?" Answering these questions when reading my own essay has helped me to eliminate fluff and strongly improved my writing skills. Once in an essay, I wrote a paragraph that aimed to explain why, in *Jane Eyre* by Charlotte Bronte, Jane's paintings symbolizes her hatred for her aunt and her murky view of society; however, instead of doing just that, I went on a huge tangent and ended up describing what the paintings look like and why Jane despises her aunt for an entire page. The grammar and structure of my writing were all fine, but there was no substance in my writing. The sheet of paper Ms. Fletcher handed to me helped me realize this.\ \ [ ]{.Apple-tab-span}One area I really need to focus on is organizing my writing. Most of the time, I write literary pieces that have no flow. I talk about three ideas all at once and I have a hard time separating them. I also tend to include everything into one huge paragraph chunk and I struggle to decide whether or not to start a new paragraph. I believe that this is the result of the lack of planning. I never really plan out my writing. Instead, I just think of everything I need to write and start writing it. However, once I start editing my writing after this process, I have a really hard time separating ideas that are all clustered together. I need to start planning out my writing before I actually start writing. Although I have many more areas that needs improvement, this is one of the main problems that I deal with consistently piece after piece.]{.s1} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Anna Quatrale =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing I tend to focus most on the flow of the ideas that I am writing about. By focusing on the flow and organization of the main ideas, I keep the reader interested in my writing and have them follow the most logical journey through my writing. Focusing on how ideas intertwine and come together to support a claim allows the reader to have a wholesome reading experience. By giving adequate "linkage points" between ideas, the reader is able to fully grasp the cohesiveness of the writing. I learned to focus on this in my A.P. Language and Composition class when my instructor told me that she felt as if she was reading a medical journal when I was writing a literary critique on ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Johnny Got His Gun]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ . I began to write as if I was speaking instead of writing and I saw my grades (and her personal satisfaction) improve greatly. Writing without using a "formula" allowed my work to sound sophisticated and well articulated. This tip also managed to help me in my writing in all other subjects too. One example of how I focused on flow was by using more elaborate and descriptive topic sentences and concluding sentences. One specific thing that I actively try to avoid is making my paragraphs in a list form. I avoid starting my paragraphs with "First, Second, Third, etc ". I instead try to tie ideas together by actually using the information I am conveying. For example, in my writing I would change "Secondly, Congress is able to override a presidential veto." into something more along the lines of "In accordance with the power to pass major legislation, Congress has the ability to override a veto on legislation through the system of checks and balances.".I feel that making these changes gives the reader an easy opportunity to understand the relevance and connection of the information being presented.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Although I feel that flow is an essential writing skill, I would like to work on writing in ways that are more professional. I need to become more versed in incorporating research into my writing. Through having more developed skills in paraphrasing or knowing when to use quotes, I feel my work would be taken more seriously. In order to do those things successfully I know I need to work on my balance between quotes and my own thoughts. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Samantha Quick ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} The issue that I notice myself consciously fixing in my writing would have to be my word choice and sentence structure. I find that whenever I write, I must reword the sentences at least two times to make the flow through a paragraph or a paper smooth. If I were to ignore the flow from paragraph to paragraph, the paper would be very choppy and hard to read. It is important for me to go through and read the paper at least two times to catch majority of my mistakes. Teachers throughout my high school career, helped me find the flow much easier and notice when something had to be changed. My family as well as some friends have also helped me with my writing, and I hope that they will continue to help me throughout college. An example of how choppy my sentences can get is this following sentence. "Everyone has a different type of music they like, and that is dependent on their childhood bring up." I would reread the sentence a couple times to determine the best way to fix the sentence. For example, "Everyone prefers a type of music over another, and that may be dependent on their childhood." I would then reread the new sentence to see if anymore changes can be made. If I feel that the new sentence is acceptable, I would move on with the paragraph, but sometimes I repeat this process three or four times. I know that to be successful in life, you must be willing to learn new skills and ideas. A skill I hope to learn or improve on during college here at Geneseo, is my use of more advanced vocabulary. I hope that I will be able to expand my vocabulary and apply it to my writing so that I appear more intellectual during my papers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sarah Quinlan =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing any paper for a class, I always make ensure that In each paragraph I am always draw the end of the topic back to the thesis of paper to ensure that I am staying on task, and following the assignment as given. This is an extremely important part of writing in my opinion, because as simple as it is to follow a task, it is just as easy to go off task. By delivering your ideas back to the thesis at the end of each paragraph it ensures that you follow the task as given, and makes sure that you are completing all requirements of the paper. My english teacher for my senior year was always checking to make sure that we were always relating our paragraphs to the thesis to help make understanding assignments easier for us. For my senior research assignment, each checkpoint she would always make sure that all of our papers were remaining on topic but going back to the thesis and keeping on task for our papers. For example, in the first sentence of my college essay I claim, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Eventually I grew tired of being that, so I made the decision to become my own person and do what I want to do", and follow by stating, "Field hockey has allowed me to be unique and be my own person."

These statements, known as critical commentary, allow any writer to make his or her paper less of a narrative and more argumentative. Critical commentary also requires evidence with analytical connecting words to back up the claims. In addition, it is important that good writers of any subject are able to identify counter arguments to their claim that they can address and argue against. I first learned what critical commentary was in my freshman year of high school but I really became familiar with it in my junior and senior years. In my English and history classes, we were taught to write this way and I learned how to apply these skills to other classes. Peer review also helped me gain a further understanding of how to use critical commentary. An example of how I used critical commentary to improve upon my writing is in an essay I was required to write for the IB Diploma program. I completely designed this essay myself, including the question. It focused on gender stereotyping and emotions in childhood. In my initial draft of the paper, I wrote,]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["Parents with 'traditional' views are more likely to impose gender-typed play than parents with 'egalitarian' views." When I edited my draft, I realized that this statement needed to be more argumentative, so I added analytical words that would help me utilize critical commentary, as well as provide examples to portray the difference between "traditional" and "egalitarian" parenting views. My edited version of this sentence states, "It can be argued that parents with different views have different likelihoods of imposing gender stereotypes on their children. This is accurate because it has been found that 'traditional' parents are more likely to expose their children to stereotypes than 'egalitarian' parents." Using critical commentary in this essay was essential in making it an analytical paper rather than a summarization of studies and opinions. In the future, I would like to work on introductory statements that will hook the reader. Starting a paper is always the most difficult part of the writing process for me. I believe that having a strong introduction allows writers to connect the rest of their piece back to something rather than having separate ideas that are in accordance with each other but do not all flow together. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kevin Ranaghan ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Kevin Ranaghan\ Professor Paku\ INTD 106\ 5 September 2019 One of my strengths as an academic writer is being able to give concrete evidence to back up a claim that I make in a formal essay, or written response. For example, I wrote a paper in my senior year of high school about why us as a society enjoy movies, songs, and other works of art that tell stories of veterans and their experiences in war. My major focus in this paper was including different pieces of art to back up my claim about how and why we listen to or read these experiences. I watched the movie Platoon (1986) and wrote about how the main character, Chris Taylor was completely changed as a human being when he entered the US military and was deployed in Vietnam. I also listened to the song "Goodnight Saigon" by Billy Joel and I made sure to emphasize that both of these sources were secondary sources. However when researching ideas for the paper I referred to some interviews of veterans who fought in the war which provided stellar credibility for my paper. My teacher for this English class in my senior year always pushed my classmates and I to provide as much detail as possible and to include evidence when making a claim. This skill is very important when writing so that a writing piece isn't bland. There is no point in making a claim and providing an opinion if there aren't details that support these statements. Something I would like to work on as a writer in my time at Geneseo is connecting all my ideas the right way. Sometimes I don't relate certain details to experiences in my own life or aspects of other works of art. I think by drawing connections between two different concepts or facts then that would strengthen my writing profoundly. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Abigail Ranieri ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Abigail Ranieri]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [Writing Reflection]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [INTD 106]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [ ]{data-contrast="auto"}[Personally, ]{data-contrast="auto"}[I really enjoy writing and is always looking for ways to become a better one.

My introductions are the strongest quality in my essays. For example, back in high school, I had to write a food memoir and connect food to my life.

The introduction to this piece was probably one of my strongest and goes like this "I can never remember the taste of my dad's butternut squash soup, but once the soul pores into my mouth my taste buds burst with memories. A vibrant orange color is produced once the ingredients get mixed together, creating a thick broth. To finish the soup off, my dad pours in heavy cream creating a white cap on the top. We always have the soup before we eat the traditional Thanksgiving food out. It is the start to our meal which makes our Thanksgiving slightly different from everyone else's. Occasionally my dad will make the soup for dinner but even then, the soup is not same as it would be during Thanksgiving. Food traditions are a big part of my family\'s life and my dad's soup is one small part.".

I learned this key concept when I was in middle school, and we started talking about essays. I was taught not to go off on tangents about off topic things. Stick to the point you were trying to come across. A more recent example of me demonstrating this skill would be in my college essay. The essay could only be so long, so I had to stick to my main theme. A teacher that specifically helped me to be concise was my college composition teacher, Ms.Trombadore. I remember her specifically going through my paper and telling me which words to get rid of. She called it, "fluff" that I did not need. A specific example from my writing what showed concision was when I wrote, \"Having time to yourself can be one of the most beneficial things you can do.\" Before editing to make it concise, I had fluff words like, \"really\" and added \"for yourself\" at the end of the sentence. I did not need these words in my sentence because I had other more important things to write in place of it. Having concision when writing is important to writing a strong, short to the point paper. Though not all writings have to be concise, it is a very applicable skill. In my future writings, I would really like to learn more about creating a solid thesis. Though when I do write theses, they are not horrible, I have struggled in the past about being able to build off my thesis into a long paper. Usually When I write essays I stick to my thesis and end up not writing as much as I should be. I should not be afraid to try complex theses to elongate my writings ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brenden Reese =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} \ When I am writing, I focus on making sure my conclusion paragraph is too repetitive. Many times when I write, my conclusion paragraph would be almost identical to the intro paragraph, making it difficult to construct a good essay because my conclusion is basically the same as my intro. Although a conclusion paragraph is supposed to summarize the essay, making it nearly the same as an intro paragraph will make an essay much less valuable. I learned how to avoid this mistake when taking a SAT prep course in 11th grade. My tutor took my sample essay and pointed out how my conclusion paragraph was too similar to my intro, which made the essay too repetitive and tough to read. For example an essay I wrote my thesis on was about sports betting, and my intro had a sentence saying \"Sports betting should be legal because it creates many job opportunities and helps the economy grow\". In my conclusion, I said \"Sports betting should be legalized because it helps the economy and creates jobs. These sentences say the exact same thing just switching the words around. Going forward, I try to hit all the major points from the essay without using sentences that I already used either in my intro or in my body paragraphs. One thing I want to improve on to make my writing more effective is instead of using synonyms when writing my conclusion, I want to reword and make the conclusion paragraph its own paragraph, without having it completely model the intro. Making this fix will result in a more complete and well written essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Daniel Regan ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In most, if not all of the academic material that I write, I like to be blunt, and straight to the point. I do this on purpose because I believe it injects whatever I'm writing, be it a paper on why the US government is responsible for the AIDS crisis or an analysis of Richard III, with a bit of myself, specifically my relatively dry sense of humor. To me, it's what separates my paper from another student\'s paper. I think a particular strength of this strategy is that it allows me to get work done faster, as this style allows me to explain whatever I'm writing in a simple way, that still manages to hook the reader. For example, my last email, to my Conventions of Creative Writing professor, Dr. Paku, simply reads: "I signed up for your online course. I've never taken an online class before. Can you guide me through what it's like?". No dilly-dallying needed, I know what I want. This style is the best way for me to articulate myself in a way that I, and others, will understand.\ My way of writing does have a pretty big weakness: it doesn't help me write long papers. In high school, there were more times than I care to admit where I would draft out a paper, be satisfied with what I wrote, look back on the assignment just to make sure that I hit all the major points I needed, and then realize that what I had written was 2-3 pages shorter than what I was assigned, and I would need to somehow stretch my draft, often ruining major aspects whatever I was writing. I don't like to explain things that I find simple in a complex way, but I do hope that I can find ways to elaborate on my points and explain things in a way that would meet the criteria, in addition to being good material. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Megan Reilly ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} While writing academically, I prioritize the structure of my work. The flow of a piece is what keeps a reader interested in the information. I think it is important to be clear and concise, without filling the writing with "fluff", or irrelevant statements in order to make the work appear longer. For example, in a high school essay about *Hamlet* I wrote, my first draft included a lot of \"fluff\" to meet the length requirement. The topic of my essay was explaining that the main character, Hamlet, is not mad but instead just damaged from the trauma of his past. My original essay included a series of sentences in a row saying in different ways that Hamlet is sane, just with different wording to try to sound more diverse. It was clear, though, that I was just restating the same point. While reading my essay over, I realized this repetition and replaced the series of sentences with one, more developed sentence followed by moving on to the next point. It was more difficult to do this since it meant I needed to come up with more concrete ideas, but helped me to think deeper about the topic. A writer should also begin with a clear yet intriguing introduction and thesis. Often times, students will feel inclined to use "fluff" in their writing due to a length requirement for a paper. Instead of expanding deeper into the topic, they continue to restate the same point they have already made. Since I am aware of this thanks to comments from my precious English teachers, I pay close attention to avoid it in my own essays and papers. While writing future papers, I would like to concentrate on using a sufficient amount of evidence to support my claims in my paper. I have a tendency to get lazy while looking for outside sources and prefer to just continue my own thoughts, forgetting the importance of supporting details, especially in an academic work. I need to take the time to find reliable sources that fit the context of my paper. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Devon Reine ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I concentrate on creating a clear thesis with solid supporting evidence in all my work. A strong thesis is an important component of any writing, I have found theses to be a helpful guide to structure my arguments. I was taught by my English teacher in eleventh grade to always make sure my thesis is prominent in my writing. Rather than inside a paragraph where it may be overlooked, she advised me to always place my thesis at the end of the first paragraph. An example of a simple and clear thesis I have written would be in an essay of mine from highschool, "John Steinbeck, author of ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Of Mice and Men]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ suggests that inequalities cause loneliness and unhappiness, through the use of the characterization of Crooks who is isolated and depressed because of his race." In this thesis I clearly state my main argument that "inequalities cause loneliness and unhappiness" and then explain how the author demonstrates that idea through the characterization of Crooks. In the following paragraphs of the essay I give three examples from the text of the racist treatment that Crooks endures and the subsequent isolation that he is forced into.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would like to work on developing my sentence structure and flow. I feel like my sentences alternate between being very simple or being run on sentences.

In my introduction, I emphasize the main points I want to establish in order to coherently explain what I am talking about.

Having an informative and well developed introduction is crucial because it is the first piece of knowledge introduced to the reader.The conclusion is just as important because it restates the main argument and sums up all the strengths that were discussed throughout the paper. I am optimistic that my tactics for developing a good introduction and conclusion are effective. My 11th grade english professor introduced me to a format on writing a well developed introduction and I applied those same skills for creating a conclusion. His tactics go over the importance of your writing technique and its effect on the reader. For example, in the introduction of my history paper titled, "The Relationship Between the United States and Latin America During the 19th Century", I stated, " The end of the Good Neighbor Policy was near and although economic and political dependence still remained in place, the respect for sovereignty and recognition for equality was becoming more apparent and strongly desired throughout Latin American countries." This generalized statement made me realize that I needed to be more clear on why recognition and equality was being desired throughout Latin America. A brief statement like that can lead to confusion for the reader. I then changed my statement to, " The end of the Good Neighbor Policy was near, despite economic and political dependence remaining in place. Latin Americans desired equality and the respect for sovereignty and this was becoming more apparent due to the United States having an effect on Latin America, stated in the U.S. and Latin American Relations textbook by Gregory Weeks." I believe this improved statement better clarifies and goes into better detail about this topic. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ In the future I hope to be more clear on my thoughts and instead of using common phrases, I plan on using this tactic to apply a better focus on what I am trying to get across throughout the introduction and conclusion of future assignments. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cassandra Reiter ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In all honesty, I do not think my writing is up to college-level standards. I find it hard to write papers or form my thoughts into discussions online or in homework. The only time I think that writing feels easy is when I am writing about my personal life or self (kind of like this). Writing informally isn't as difficult - it feels as if I am telling the reader something in a one-sided conversation. Last semester, I took a poetry class. In one poem for my portfolio, I wrote about my brain feeling like a racecar; how it was fast-paced and was about to crash. I wrote "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Am I going to eat today? /]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ damages my axel and I'm left skidding / into the wall of / ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[when's the last time I showered? /]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ & ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[do my friends hate me? / ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[When I regain myself I am dented." It felt good and powerful to write about it. Truly, it is a strength of mine. In the first drafts of the poem, we held a workshop for students' poems and we reacted to it and offered advice on how to change to make it seem comprehensive and overall our best pieces. My classmates called my poem "vulnerable", and "raw". They offered constructive criticism on line breaking, wording, and italics. In my final portfolio, it was my best poem of the three and everyone enjoyed hearing it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Persuasive essays seem easy until I run out of reasons to be for or against a product or opinion. After that, refuting a claim seems hard because I might accidentally sway myself to the other side. Planning a paper like that out in a self-made rubric helps to lighten the workload on the occasion. Writing seems easier when I make a bulleted list of "Claim, reason, example, reason, example, summarize, lead into the next paragraph". I want to get better at writing papers in general, as I'm sure that it will help me with almost everything in college. Even now, it is hard to reach a minimum of 200 words, despite talking about what I'm bad at and what I want to learn and make better in my writing.

My thesis is the crucial point of my essay and oftentimes, the structure of my essay revolves around my final thesis. If I can create a clear and provoking thesis, the main points of my essay will be easy to understand through the reader's perspective. It can be hard to point out the main reasons for the passage when there is various information included throughout the essay. This idea came from my 10th grade history and AP Literature teachers, where we had to write research papers and construct a thesis where it would flow and connect nicely to the rest of the body paragraphs. My 10th grade history teacher was also very specific about having exactly three reasonings, to make the thesis more straightforward and easier to understand. I would use this style for almost all of my writings unless it is a broader topic and can't be concise. In order to help us construct a thesis, we would do outlines and from the outlines I was able to see whether or not my thesis would go well together with my topic sentences or body paragraphs. At first, I didn't quite understand why creating a good thesis is so important, although once I started doing this, I was influenced by their writing style and it made me realize that it was a lot easier for me to build upon my body paragraphs basing off the thesis. To structure my thesis, I first like to gather the main ideas that I am planning to write about. Thesis can come in different structures, although I would always structure my thesis as if I am answering the big question with three different reasonings. After coming up with the three different reasonings, I would continue with creating topic sentences that can easily resonate with three different body paragraphs that I will be elaborating on. An example of a thesis that I wrote using the outline structure would be, "In the 1900s, contraception changed women's roles in the United States by granting more political freedom and power for women, expanding educational opportunities, and most importantly, advancing women's economic empowerment." Based on the thesis that I wrote, I was able to clearly state my reasoning as to why contraception changed women's roles in the United States. This gives the readers a sense of what the essay will be about, and to develop thoughts based on the thesis throughout the essay. This skill is very helpful not only to me (as a writer) but to those reading my pieces because it allows them to understand the main idea that I am trying to convey through my writing. This will also give my writing a very clear structure to follow and understand, instead of jumping from one idea to another. It creates a steady flow in an essay, which is very important in order to keep the readers engaged and understand what they are reading. Some areas that I need to develop on are grammar and elaborating on the quotes that I have chosen. Instead of choosing a quote and just redefining the quotes, I will try to expand on it and establish my perspective in a way where they would all come together and be interconnected. In order to improve on my grammar skills, I would just need to practice more on my writing skills and revise. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nat Riccardi ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I am writing, I focus specifically on the vocabulary I use and how often I use it. When I first started high school, I remember being told to \'expand my use of vocabulary\' and to take notice of the frequency in which I use certain words or phrases. As high school went on and I began to write more and more, I developed the skills necessary to prevent repetition and dull vocabulary. This new habit has improved all aspects of my writing, from creative to academic. My twelfth grade English teacher, Mr. Delle Bovi, was very influential in my vocabulary expansion, as he consistently provided me with vocabulary lists for me to learn and use in my writing. I am now confident in my vocabulary use, and in my ability to write without constant repetition. While writing this essay, I was reminded specifically of my common app essay, the topic for which I changed about five times. Originally, I was going to write about lacrosse, which proved difficult because there\'s really only so many times you can say the words \'teamwork\' and \'determination\' without sounding like you\'re repeating yourself; but eventually I settled on writing about how hard it was for me to pick a topic. This provided the opportunity not only to use a variety of vocabulary, but was also a broad enough topic that I didn\'t feel the need to reword sentences that sounded too familiar. This skill has made me more confident in every aspect of my writing, from formal essays to text messages to my friends describing my weekend adventures. In order to continue to advance my writing, I believe my next focus should be on the length (or lack thereof) of my sentences. Occasionally my sentences will be too short which makes my writing sound choppy, but other times they will run on which confuses the reader to the point that they may have to re-read the sentence several times to comprehend it. I believe that an effective way for me to improve on this is to have someone else proof-read my writing, that way if they notice an error in my sentence length I will be able to fix it. Additionally I think an effective way to improve on my sentence skills may be to read more, which will provide me with a constant example as to how long sentences should be. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Aidan Rice ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I've always been conscious about strongly bolstering my opinions and beliefs with evidence, on any paper/argument I talk about. Without evidence, your opinions on a topic could be proven wrong or faulty. Backing up your argument with concrete examples and facts verifies your views, and has the ability to sway the opinions of others to agree with you. I worked very hard on this part of my writing throughout my junior year, in my AP English Writing/Composition class. On papers, our teacher would have us clearly state our theme/point of view, and have us support it with evidence from a text for viable online source. An example would be originally saying "I think that Real Madrid is the best soccer team in the world." Instead of just saying that, an appropriate statement would be "Real Madrid is the best soccer team in the world because they have won the most Champions League trophies compared to any and all other teams in the world." In the new statement, I state my opinion and provide a fact that directly supports the claim. Moving forward, I would like to focus on my introductions, and clearly stating the theme of the paper I'm working on. An introduction is very important, as it should not only inform the audience of what the paper is about, it should also persuade them to continue reading. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexandria Richards ================================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing I mainly focus on is specification.

I say this because as you learn something new about adapting to writing skills, your work of writing gets better along the way. The level of writing is meant to be changed as you transition grade levels. I am grateful that here at Geneseo, we have a Writing Learning Center where other students help those who struggle on challenging papers that have to be written or any assignment involving writing. Having these resources allows me to strengthen and develop a new strategy of writing that establishes a well known understanding of what makes an excellent paper an excellent paper.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When revising my resume, I did not realize how important it was to make sure my experiences and data were properly ordered.

I try and stay organized because then my writing will overall sound better and be more well thought out. Organization can be very helpful because while making different drafts and final copies you can get to the best place for your writing when you revise and perfect. Rewriting and adding different points and comments to your drafts. Different people in my life have influenced how I keep my writing organized, but I think my Mom has done the best job showing me this. She\'s always told me to just write what my heart desires and then go back and fix it later, take out the unnecessary things and keep the main points with examples. For example for my speech that I wrote at the end of the year for dance, I made sure to have an organized set up of how I was giving it to everyone listening. I made sure that I went over the course of all of the years I\'ve danced in order of different experiences I\'ve had, which showed my growth and allowed my piece to have pathos and had an affect on everyone listening. Every time there is a correction to the writing piece it will make it better and allow for an easier flow of reading for the reader of it. Organizing in your writing is also how you present your information to the reader. The flow of how you decide to write can change the reader\'s perspective of what your saying by the way you write it. One aspect I would like to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo for the next four years and beyond would be my vocabulary use. I would love to expand my vocabulary because it allows you know become more familiar with different ways of speaking and drawing in your reader using words that you normally wouldn\'t hear or would make the reading more interesting because it sounds different from other things usually heard. Vocabulary is a huge aspect in writing to help your writing pieces stronger and allow for more attentive reading. My biggest hope is to get the most out of Geneseo\'s classes and experience and learn new words to help my writing and the way I speak in general. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Allyssa Richmond ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I already focus on in my own writing, including while I revise my drafts, is using diction in order to clearly convey my overall point, or thesis, of my paper, in a cohesive, and coherent manner. If I were to use the same word choices in my introductions and thesis statements, such as starting out multiple successive sentences with \"I feel that\...,\" my writing would be extremely repetitive, and my reader would be bored. Not only that, but it also would not help me in any way to improve my academic and professional tone. In my twelfth grade english 101 and 103 classes, my teacher gave me feedback on my diction in the first draft of my research paper that I wrote on the environmental and genetic influences on mental illness. She noticed, and commented on the fact that I was very repetitive in the way that I described things. For example, in my research paper, I used the word \"illness\" many times in a row to describe the subject of my paper, when I could have also used the word \"disorder\" in addition to \"illness.\" Since then, I have become much more consciously aware when it comes to the words that I choose to use in all of my writing. I feel that learning skills is an extremely important aspect of good academic writing, especially college writing, because it positively adds to the overall professional tone of the writing, as well as the ethos of the writing. As I continue to progress in my academic writing throughout my college years, I would like to focus on expanding my sentence structure, and incorporating more stylistic elements into my work. I think that I utilize the same few literary elements and types of figurative language too much in my writing, including anaphora, imagery, simile, and parallel structure. I feel that I could broaden my knowledge on the many different types of literary elements and figurative language, as well as the different types of sentence structure, and use them to enrich my writing, and improve my overall academic and professional voice. Some literary elements, types of figurative language, and sentence structure I would like to utilize in order to develop my writing include: paradox, oxymoron, epistrophe, metaphor, repetition, the use of colons and semi-colons to join clauses, and independent and dependent clauses. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Timothy Rise ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Timothy Rise I make an effort to work quotes into my writing to make it flow and seem professional as much as I can because it makes the piece sound better and in turn, makes me feel better about how I write. I try to use fancier words in my writings as well because I feel that it makes my work at least sound more sophisticated. Word choice and making my quotes seem cohesive and coherent to my essays are what I constantly look at when revising and rewriting. This makes what I write, to me, seem well written. Also, these elements allow the reader see the seriousness of the work and the time and effort that was put in. It was my eleventh grade English teacher who pushed me to do this throughout that course. Due to this change, my grades have been pushed higher than they would be without the change. An example of this would be in my twelfth grade year when I was assigned a controversial topic to write about, abortion. \"[There are many politically driven debates fluttering around in social media, with few being legitimately well versed on any of the topics they take part in. One of the more active topics with lies constantly being thrown around is abortion.\" I went back many ties with a thesaurus to try and find better words that made this introduction sound professional, along with the sources and the different quotes used. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Areas that need improvement consist of making my introductions and conclusions longer as they usually span around 3 sentences each. Why do I do this? I do not know. I hope that this class will provide me with the necessary instruction to improve this are of my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kaleigh Ristau ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I focus mainly on the objective that I am trying to get across to the reader. Unless I am writing an essay where I have to give my opinion on a topic or subject, I try to remain neutral in my pieces. This aspect of writing is important, especially when talking about news or current topics of the news. For example, this was very important in classes like U.S. history and government back in high school. If a writing piece were to just contain one side to an argument or one part of an important subject, the reader would have a less likely chance in creating their own opinion about the topic. I believe I attained objective writing by using skills and advice that was given to me in twelfth grade from my history teacher where I look at my writing in a perspective as someone who knows nothing about the topic being discussed. Some of these skills include talking in the third person point of view, carefully choosing words when making comparisons, being specific when it comes to details and even being carefully when it comes to using gender neutral phrases especially in today\'s day and age. These techniques allow me to either write in way were all perspectives are being discussed equality or write factually and not give an opinion on the topic, just facts and accurate data I had found. An example would be that I change something like "Before a congressman can vote, he needs to fully informed of the topic" or "Female athletes are misrepresented in the media" to: " Before a member of congress can vote, they need to be fully informed of the topic" or "According to an article posted by ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Washington Post]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, men's sports receive 96.3% of coverage in sports media while women's sports only receive 1.6%."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward at SUNY Geneseo, I would like to add more complexity to my writing. I feel as though in the past I have been to vague in my writing, so I want to be able to add that extra layer of intricacy to make my paper more dense and knowledgeable. Rather than just a vague overview, I want to be able to show my deep understanding of what is being discussed. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Janessa Rivera ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [So a skill that I would like to change is that I can't make specific claims. I am always very general when making my statements instead of being assertive because I don't think that my process of thinking of a thesis statement is good. Having an essay with a strong thesis will help carry the rest of my essay and make things easier for the reader to understand what my essay is about and how that will be able to support my evidence. If I don't have something that it cohesive, how is anyone really supposed to know why my essay is important and how my evidence ties back to it. So I have always had a really tough time with making good thesis statements so I\'ve heard from many teachers to be more specific. So recently we just had to peer review our essays and my comments were that I have to make my thesis more specific but I had good ideas. An example is " I believe that all people deserve to have access to an equal opportunity to education. All people with different backgrounds, whether it be gender, race, and socio-economic backgrounds should be able to get an education. This is important because it helps people grow and become more integrated in society to become an active member, it also helps bridge the gap between social classes." And yeah this is good but it needs to be shorter and less wordy and be straight to the point. I feel like this is important because academically I should be able to write about why things are important and present it in a way that makes sense to the broader audience. If I could be more fluent in writing and just gather up what I want to say in just a few sentences than I think I would be able to do well in my essays. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: James Roach ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I already focus on consciously as I revise my drafts is proofreading. Many people think proofreading can be a waste a time but that is not true at all. When I write, its almost a given that I\'m not going to write a perfect piece the first time. Most of the time, something, somewhere in my piece is not going to make sense. There will be mistakes, and that is okay. That is why I proofread. To make sure I am writing and handing in the best work I can. My eleventh grade teacher, Mrs. Hull, truly helped me with this skill. Before then I would just write my paper the night before and hand it in. I would get good grades and everything but it was not my best work. High school grading is way more lenient too but when I took her class, she really me me rethink about writing and revising. For homework one night, we had to write a paragraph about a short story we were reading in class. I handed in the assignment in time and the next day she told me to stay after class. Being myself, I started to freak out but all she wanted to do was go over my piece. As she was reading it aloud, I could tell instantly that some of it did not make any sense. For example, I said, \"Holden went upstairs to go down to the lavender room\...\" Ever since then, I always proofread my writing. In the future, I want to start free writing more. It is hard for me to get my initial thoughts on paper, and people tell me all the time to try this skill out. I think it is a very important skill to learn because once I am able to free write effectively, I could really have a good piece in the works. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mary Roberts ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Mary Roberts When writing a persuasive or argumentative essay, I am careful in choosing the sources as to where I get information. In the past papers I have written, I have either chosen to site and reference non-credible people and facts or sited an overbearing number of sources. This was the case with my junior year research paper; the topic I chose to write about was how technology has negatively affected the cognitive development of adolescents. For the first draft of my paper, I sited too many sources to the point that not enough of my paper was my analysis. Since I had referenced so many sources, some, in turn, had been practically irrelevant to the thesis at hand and only deterred from the paper itself. My English teacher gave me feedback about how it is important to choose enough sources to get your point across and pick ones that help your paper. I was told that it is vital to select credible sources to improve upon the ethos and logos of the paper that I am writing. This is important because it establishes the credibility of the paper I am writing to the reader. The more reliable the sources that I reference in my writing are, the more valid that and my analysis will sound to the reader. This is the most important feedback I have received about writing an argumentative paper because without my paper having the necessary tools to convince the reader of my thesis, there is no persuasion. Now when picking sources, I am careful to choose ones from credible and knowledgeable people and studies related to the topic at hand. I was taught to do this for the final draft of the aforementioned research paper, and it only improved the logos and ethos of my paper. This is what I hope to continue to improve during my time here at Geneseo and beyond college. I would like to develop a writing style that includes an effective balance of ethos, pathos, and logos that will establish my credibility as a writer to the reader of my work. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Robledo ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The main thing that I focus on as a writer is my ability to properly create an effective introductory paragraph. I have found throughout my academic career that I am able to easily and effectively deliver the initial hook to my reader and easily guide them into my thesis and subsequently the rest of my essay. In terms of what shaped my ability to write effective introductory paragraphs for my essays, credit would absolutely have to be given to my AP English literature teacher from my senior year of high school. He always constantly stated to the class that one of the most important aspects of an essay was the introduction, as it serves as the jumping off point for the reader that pulls them in with an intriguing opening statement and keeps them interested with the introduction of core concepts to the essay.My personal best in my opinion is the introduction found in my eagle scout essay and this if for a few different reasons. I believe that my hook was engaging and interesting (being that of a metaphor for the life cycle of a bird) and that the details following set the stage well for my story on becoming an Eagle scout. I personally am very content with my skills in terms of writing introductions however there is always room for improvement when it comes to any skill. For example, when it comes to my body paragraphs, i feel that I oftentimes have a lot of filler words and unnecessary extra phrasing that fogs up my message and exhausts my reader. A possible way to stop falling into this habit would be to make sure that no word is used without some form of clear benefit to the work, whether it be increasing style or increasing the clarity of my language. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joshua Roderick ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Joshua Roderick]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [Professor ]{data-contrast="auto"}[Paku]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [INTD 106-01]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [29 August 2019]{data-contrast="auto"}[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [Throughout my writing I try to emphasize the use of visualization and imagery to better assist the reader in understanding the topics at hand.

With this course we analyzed literary works and musicals for approaches to literature and writing techniques, one of those techniques being imagery. The use of visualization I\'m confident that I can depict situations and emphasize important subjects in my writing more effectively. An example of my use of imagery to strengthen a readers understanding could be "I can feel the sensations as if I am still there; the sound of the rushing river, the feel of the crisp summer wind, the fragrance of blooming flowers, the warmth of the summer sun and the coolness of the shade. They accompany the memories I developed with my father as he took me hunting and fishing throughout the years. The two of us have been going fishing together since I was able to hold a pole; we participated in the Youth Hunt weekends throughout Central New York until I could hunt at age 16. Nature has been a constant throughout my life, and I have become infatuated with its different niches."

It is important to make sure the thesis and introductory sentence makes sense and clearly states what you are arguing. I have gotten many feedbacks from previous teachers and professors who do encourage me to be more expressive and detailed about what I will ultimately write in my body paragraphs because you want the reader to be intrigued just by reading the first couple of sentences. One example is when one of my sentences was written as, "There are many reasons as to why humans are causing global warming." I of course revised it to, "Burning fossil fuels, littering, and overusing electricity are some examples of why humans are causing global warming." One aspect I want to develop effectively for the future is to just be less vague with my writing. It is important that any writer utilizes sources to help them with their argument but not to the point where we just copy and paste what those sources provide.

Throughout my years in middle and high school the "ICEY method" was taught to help introduce and support evidence. The "ICEY method" stands for Introduce, Cite, Explain, and wh(y). The method starts with ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**introducing**[ the idea you are going to support. In basic terms, a topic sentence. The textual support, is the quote itself. But, after including the quote it's necessary to properly ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**cite**[ it to give the author credit. The last piece is the ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**explanation**[ of the quote. At this point I ask myself, "wh]{style="font-weight: 400;"}**(y**[) am I including this quote?" This allows me to not only clarify the meaning of the quote, but to also justify the importance of incorporating it. The "why" is a great checkpoint to make sure I am staying on topic and relating ideas back to the thesis. The importance of this skill is using and explaining evidence in an organized manner without plagiarism. This method has been embedded into my writing process by my past teachers. I remember being introduced to "ICEY" and filling out worksheets that separated the letters into boxes. When the sheet was completed you would put the sentences in the boxes together to construct proper textual support. In an essay for my IB Language class last year I wrote:]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["Native Africans were marginalized in the text for they were described by Conrad as animalistic and inhuman. Conrad states " the men were- No, they were not inhuman... they howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces: but what thrilled you was the thought of their humanity- like yours the remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar"(Conrad 44). The word kinship is valid in proving the Africans were treated as insignificant because it shows that the only similarities between the two foils were their blood ties.

Often when I write, I state things in a way that I understand, but are incomprehensible to others, or can be easily misinterpreted. I am also quite wordy, which adds to my poor phrasing. This causes a problem and makes my writing more difficult, and less interesting, to read. If the intended audience cannot understand what I am trying to say, my point will be lost and then my writing is less significant. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My seventh grade English teacher shed a light on this concept for me. Our assignment was to do a project on a book we read, and one of the main points was the summary. She told us to imagine that we had never read the book before, and see if our work made sense. I found that some things no longer made sense without more context of the book. By reading in another perspective, I understood how to patch the gaps in my phrasing. Another person who helped me realize my common habit of poor phrasing was my mom. Often, she proof reads my work, as another set of eyes. Sometimes, she shows me a more forward and concise way to state things, rather than "talking around my work." A written example of my phrasing before my revision is from a summary I have recently created about the main idea of an article I read. Before editing my first sentence was, "In the New York Times article, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Veterans Want Past Discharges to Recognize Post-Traumatic Stress," ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[the author focuses on the struggles veterans face with PTSD as well as their struggle being diagnosed with it. What I was trying to say was that the main idea of the piece was the effect PTSD has on veterans, AND action the government does or does not take for soldiers with PTSD.

He also shares the government's impact on former soldiers' lives in regards to PTSD." By adding the section about the government's impact on soldiers with PTSD, it became more clear to the reader that the government would be significant in this article. Otherwise, the reader would not understand what, "the struggle being diagnosed with it," meant.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In future pieces I plan to work on summarizing an author's point, and sections of their work. Often, I am too detailed in a summary, that I lose the reader and my point becomes unclear.

This resulted in my English teacher commenting at the end of my essay "This was always a fuzzy thesis, and I don't think the paper clarifies it as much as you wanted to. It relies heavily on opinion and perception rather than on analysis." In the end, though I should be conscious of my word choice, grammar, and phrasing as part of my revisions (as I have been), I should also make sure that my main idea and thesis are viable as well.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Therefore, with my time at Geneseo I'd like to develop my skills involving the communication of clear, coherent main ideas and theses.

It established my topic, claim, and what info I'd be presenting without too much detail. What I struggle to do is assert my argument. I keep stating facts and info and summarize way too much that my body paragraphs just turn into something like my intro.

Encouraging me in this process, I would often go over my practice essays with my literature professor to limit the number of words in my sentences. For example, in a reflection of Kurt Vonnegut's perspective in the novel Cat's Cradle I stated, "The events in the novel connect to his view of society and politics in the sense that no one ever got along, society was harsh and neglected those who lacked normality, and was bound to end up in a devastated state due to an inevitable downfall", in my introductory paragraph. Although I was able to gather understanding of an idea, it was necessary to cut back on word count or reorganize the sentence structure to create a more concise presentation. To improve, I rewrote these ideas as, " Vonnegut's view of society and politics are channeled in events that depict a societal inability to coexist as attacking difference leads to inevitable downfall". I was able to keep my original ideas, but express them more clearly to my reader.

Personally, writing thesis statements for me has not been entirely easy, as there are many formats that people use to write them. During my high school years, I took AP English Language and Composition as well as English Literature and Composition, and while taking these classes, I have come to realize that AP classes require or prefer a specific type of thesis statement that should only be one sentence and definitely no more than two.\ My most recent English teacher that I had told me that my thesis statements were ok, and that they held some important information, however, he kept mentioning to me that I needed to make them shorter, while also still being able to capture the audience's attention. The most recent essay that I could use for textual evidence is one from a year ago about the nonfiction novel Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand. My thesis statement in this essay is three sentences long, which looking back on it, is way too long: "The extreme measures that jockeys will and do take to become something in the eyes of the racing industry shows that a person's audacity and indefatigable efforts can lead them to the win of their lives. The moods of becoming a jockey and actually making it in the industry differ tremendously. However, they seem to be quite similar in that the horse and the jockey never stop trying to be the best that they can be."\ My English teacher last year, for my senior year of high school, would help me shorten my thesis statements, but he would never completely change them. He would tell me that I had good detail in my thesis statements, however, they were too long and took a while to get to the point. I believe that thesis statements are just as important as introductions, because they help set up the argument that the rest of the essay is going to be focused on. The thesis is basically the starter for the essay.\ I am definitely open to the idea that my writing is not perfect, because I know that it isn\'t. I try to improve on it everyday, as I would like to publish a novel of my own one day. During my time here at Geneseo, I would like to improve upon my thesis statements by making them shorter, but yet still detailed and encapsulating. I would also like to touch upon balance in my essays, specifically structure. I want to be able to more clearly state an argument and then touch upon it with an answer, compared to what I currently do now, which is mostly stating an argument and then beating around the bush. Perhaps this writing course can help me more with my 'problem', and help me find ways to create an efficient and interesting thesis, and develop a more structured essay with comparisons, contrasts, and discussions. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rocio Ruiz ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ When given an assignment of writing I typically focus on setting the tone through my introduction and conclusion. I want my audience to be interested in reading more of my essay thus having a specific tone shows my attitude and perspective about what I'm writing. The summer of twelfth grade I had an assigned research paper about current issues, I wrote about immigration families being separated through the Zero Tolerance Policy and how that affects children. In my introduction I applied tone in my thesis, "In these facilities children are receiving similar treatment as to animals or even prisoners. Innocent children should not be treated as such. These unfair and outrageous immigration laws affect children psychologically, thus leaving negative effects on immigrant and refugee children and their families". My teacher mentioned how I should apply my own voice more on my writing rather than focusing too much on making it sound "eloquent". In my introduction I have a cautionary candid tone where I hope to get the audience to be interested in reading more while at the same time evoke some sort of reaction from them. In my conclusions I make sure to emphasize certain key points from my introduction but also strike new ideas that will allow the audience to take away something from the essay. Meanwhile through the body paragraphs I inform my audience with mostly facts, statistics, and interpretations about the topic.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Moreover, I hope to improve and become a better writer. I feel like I have great ideas and thoughts but I don't know how to word or phrase them in my writing therefore I end up going on tangents. I don't want to mislead my audience but I feel like I struggle with making my essays flow and make it difficult for the reader to understand.

The presence of an effective voice helps to create personality and perspective within a piece, and, overall, it assists me in getting my point across in a straightforward and comfortable fashion. Some advice I have consistently been given in past writing courses is to avoid thesaurus' at all costs, and to read my writing out loud to myself. By avoiding the usage of a thesaurus, you force yourself to look to your own vocabulary for the right word, and you keep yourself from using words and phrases that are, essentially, someone else's, and that you would never use conversationally. The use of a thesaurus often leads to misplaced words and confused definitions, and causes writing to lose its authenticity. Reading your writing out loud to yourself as you are completing it allows you to receive the information and points you have organized in the same way that another reader will, and makes it easier to establish whether or not your writing is clear and smooth. For example, in a paper I wrote for an American Politics course I took last semester, I had a hard time finding room for a voice in my writing. The paper discussed the relationship between the social contract and our electoral system and was very lengthy and informationally dense. After several revisions, I found a few places where I could add my own personality and perspective, particularly in the introductory paragraph and in my conclusion. The paper, as a whole, is a call for electoral reform, and maps out the way in which it should be carried out, alongside the consequences of ignoring this broken system. I use my final paragraph as an opportunity to express my personal concerns stating that "there is no way that United States citizens will continuously trust a government that does not represent them or listen to them. If that trust is lost, then the social contract is broken, and this will result in the destruction of the society we have created". Speaking dramatically, but also truthfully adds emotion into a normally dry, academic topic, and while there could be even more of a voice present, I am aware of the difference it makes and would like to continue to improve upon developing it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Louis Sabatino ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Louis Sabatino]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD-106-01]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [9/5/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of my academic writing that I believe is strong is my use of imagery. I personally feel that imagery is a great way to make the reader comprehend your writing and overall your main idea. One great example of my use of imagery is my college essay. My college essay was about my cousin and how he has always been an inspiration to me even through his dark times; in this I talked about my cousins life and his fascinating yet tragic stories. I gave all the details I could so I felt my reader had an accurate representation of the story. I did this by using the five senses, for example I would talk about how the scene smelled to get the reader to feel in a sense that they were there. Also, I gave a vivid description of his appearance, the background, everything my eyes saw in the day he told me his story; I did this to make the audience see what I saw. This is something I do well as a writer, I am very descriptive and am able to express details in a way that my reader clearly understands. My teacher from high school and William Shakesphere introduced me to the literary device imagery. When my teacher gave me a revised copy she pointed out that yes I vividly described the story but I failed to focus on how it affected me. She said that I got so stuck in the details of the story that I did not indepthly showed how these experiences affected me. When I went to make my corrections in my essay I was better able to connect myself into the story while also making a connection to my reader. By doing this they better understood my story and not just my cousins. This is the area of my writing that I would like to focus more of my effort into while I am writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ana Salazar ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One thing that I pay close attention in my writing is the format and conciseness of my introduction. The introduction of a paper or piece of writing is the first thing they read, therefore I want to make it clear to them what exactly it is that I\'m writing about. I try to give some background and context about the topic, followed by what the format of the paper is going to look like. If my introduction are just random statements about the topic that are not precisely linked to each other and a thesis at the end, then the reader will have a hard time figuring out what exactly I'm writing about. I prefer to make it clear and concise from the beginning. An example of this would be "One of the many consequences still felt by the corruption of colonialism is the socioeconomic gap in Peru. This has persisted since the conquistador Francisco Pizarro, arrived in the territory. The unequal distribution of wealth among people, along with a forced class structure, differentiated the white population as the superior race. The caste system, established by the Spanish, consisted of ethnic classifications fueled by racism. The Spanish violently colonized Indians as an effort to obtain cheap labor and resources. Throughout the history of Peru Indians have been exploited, discriminated against, and massacred as a result of the social structure system put in place by the Spanish; maintained by the white elites after independence. Centuries of mistreatment and belittlement have created deep divides between the upper class and the lower class, the latter mainly consisting of indigenous people. Therefore, the socio-economic gap created by colonialism has opened up the doors to rural uprisings in Peru. A significant uprising being the communist militant group, Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)." I believe my focus on the format of my introduction comes from my middle and high school teachers who stressed this. I think this is a good habit to have, but I have other areas in my writing that I would like to improve. One of the main things that I want to improve is writing more complex sentences. Also, I want to improve my grammar because as an ESL student who placed out of ESL towards the end of middle school, I was never taught proper grammar and why the rules work the way they do. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Thais Salazar =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} My main focus is on the key information that we write in our body paragraphs that help us understand the answers to the question that is being asked in the first paragraph. The reason that I established this because by having key information in the paragraphs makes a connection between what I read and what I have learned. By having this key information, this would knowledge the support that you\'re answering the question and establish the point of your thesis statement. I state that I have the captivity to state the point of any writing assignments that would allow me to offer to support the developmental links of the paper. I achieved this reasonable writing skills by a writing course in my freshmen year in SUNY Geneseo. I think about the information that a writing professor has taught me. The professor has taught me the idea of having your "ducks" in a row. I did find this process not only an extraordinary but an exceptional way to organize information. When you have the topic sentences all ready to go on the outline, I start pulling out information that has a strong vocal connection to the topic sentences. For example, in my paper about how procrastination causes laziness. I stated as the topic sentences, "A reason that makes a person a procrastinator is being a perfectionist." I used that from the reading that was provided by the professor. One of the reasons that I gave from "Coping with Procrastination" was that "... the harsh judgment of ourselves that creates the problems. We are standards that are too high and judge ourselves critically..." (Moore, Baker, Packer, 1997). Then I explained the quote by stating that we as students make ourselves go into some panic to become a perfectionist and that why students tend to procrastinate in doing our assignments when they are due. Going forward, I have acknowledged that every single skill that needs to be part of to make every essay unbelievable; that including the key information or quotes that might need connect the information to the thesis and to make sense. An aspect that I notice that I should work on is grammar that makes me feel intimidated because I do not know if it is right or wrong usage of a word.

I have to make sure my thesis is clear and says what the paper will answer. I also have to make sure that the thesis blends into the rest of the intro paragraph. Making sure it is the semi conclusion to the section I just wrote. The way I write my thesis is that it is a clear statement that can be on its own. An example of a paper I wrote that has a clear thesis is an essay I wrote about why communism is not valid. I wrote this in my Government class as a senior here it is, "Out of these three political systems, Communism, Laissez-Faire Capitalism, and Socialism, Communism is the least inefficient economic system." This example shows that I'm making a clear statement about the stance the paper will take on communism. In a draft of the article, I say something like "I believe communism is the weakest form of government." This thesis makes it seem more like an option and then more up to interaction, making it a weaker thesis and a thinner paper. The classes that help me with doing this process for writing thesis was my English classes in late middle school to early high school. Other courses that taught me to write through this process was my resource classes. I was in these classes until I was a senior in high school. These classes help me by looking at everything I wrote and checked it for grammatical mistakes. One aspect I have trouble in my writing is writing a grammatically sound paper. My writing usually sounds awkward with their being a lot of misuse of commas, sentences that go to long and not the best use of diction in my writing. So at Geneseo, I hope to get this part of my writing stronger. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Zach Saltzman =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of writing I already focus on is how I incorporate quotes into my writing. This writing skill is very important as quoting is very important when it comes showing evidence for arguments made in assignments. Throughout middle school and high school, I had many teachers who helped me become better at incorporating quotes into writing, however none of the teachers helped me more than Mr. Willgoos my 8^th^ and 10^th^ grade English teacher. He taught me various way to incorporate quotes such learning how to imbed quotes and to use colons correctly. Before I learned how to quote correctly, I was infamous for the amount of hit and quotes. Now after learning from Mr. Willgoos, I learned how to imbed quotes properly. An example of me imbedding a quote in Mr. Willgoos' class is was about the book *A* Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin. In this can be seen when I spoke about how "Ged separated metaphorically from community when Ged created a fog that "closed and thickened all over \[his\] village, greying the light, blurring the world till a man could hardly see his own hands before him."(pg. 13)" This shows how I can seamlessly imbed a quote. I feel like the area that I need the most improvement is with verb tense. This is because in one of my previous assignments in the spring semester for my Western Humanities class, my professor pointed out how I constantly made mistakes when it came to verb tense. This assignment I am talking about is about Christine de Pizan's *The Book of the City of Ladies* and if , if Gertrude and Ophelia from William Shakespeare's *The Tragedy of Hamlet* would qualify to go there. As a result of the notes my professor at the time put on the paper after he returned it to me, he made me realize how I have a problem when it comes to verb tense. This is why I want to learn how avoid this issue from happening again during my time at Geneseo. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Henry Samson ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing I try to us very descriptive verbs in order to emphasize the point I am making in my writing as well as to set up the rest of the essay. I do not simply pick words that just sound good in the sentence but words that will add emphasize the importance to the overall essay . In my essays when I am writing about a book or something of that nature I always introduce the book with a descriptive word in order to give the book or whatever I\'m writing about almost an identity, to give the reader an idea of what they can expect when reading this novel or excerpt. An example of this would be when I start the introduction of a book, I would usually begin with a slight summary that gave a brief but thorough insight on the piece of writing. Also, the last piece of writing I revised was my senior year research project and when I viewed it a few days ago I noticed a few mistakes or even critiques that could potentially benefit my future in writing. If there was one thing I would enjoy learning is to provide a better summary that more accurately describes the theme and purpose of the piece of my writing. The Great Gatsby is a great example, when I introduced the book I would start it of with a word such as in the \"deceitful book Great Gatsby\" or even in the lust driven book\.... this gives the reader an idea of what is going to take place during the entirety of the novel. My high school AP English played a big role in my ability to use descriptive words in my writing. He would critic my writing and inserted more descriptive words then I use in order to expand my vocabulary. My parents also played a important role in trying to have as big of a vocabulary as I possibly can because it makes me sound extremely intelligent when I am talking to adults and future bosses. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicole Sanchez-Guichardo ====================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing essays I tend to focus on making sure there are supporting details to my claim or statement. My essays are always structured with my claim to start off the paragraph followed by three supporting details and then a closing statement. I feel like this structure of writing helps my words flow better instead of my thoughts being all over the place. This template was taught to me in the ninth grade by my english teacher, and has worked for me ever since. Paragraph structure is very important because it makes it easier for the reader to comprehend the point that the author is trying to get across. Too many ideas in a paragraph can be confusing and all over the place. For example in one of my previous writings I began the paragraph with "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Macon Dead is the personification of African American middle class who wants to merge themselves with the White American culture because of his greed.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[" ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[I then go on to reinforce that statement with three supporting details/ examples.

Many times I would have a claim and then my supporting details will just be quotes from the source without any deep explanation as to how it ties into the big idea. Maybe next time I can dive deeper into an idea without focusing on the evidence. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kate Saracelli ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I mostly tend to focus on highlighting the main topics I'm going to talk about in my writing because it's a guideline to my reader on what the essay is going to be addressing. Identifying what the essay is going to be about is such an easy guide to give the reader an idea what the topics being discussed are. Starting in my freshman year of high school, my school board decided that giving the entire student body certain essays to write twice a year would help expand this skill among the students. It certainly has trained my brain to automatically start writing essays this way. An example would be in my essay from last year in my Anth 100 class. I subtly tried to introduce the topics being discussed without just saying it. The second sentence reads, "My grandmother had many topics on her mind that she wished to discuss, but she mostly emphasized on religion, race, and gender roles." These were the three topics I discussed in the report. I would really like to develop more in proper grammar and punctuation as well as having conclusion sentences at the end of my paragraphs. I usually feel shy when asking for help so I tend to not ask for it when I need it, so I can be braver and ask for help on developing and strengthening these areas.

In AP Research I looked at the correlation between socioeconomic status and teen pregnancy in New York State. I had to create my own research method to study this. The paper also required a minimum of 20 sources and 4,000 words. This was very hard for me to work through because there was so many different perspectives to look at. Having 20 sources is a lot to work with so I was very overwhelmed. I decided to start out being as organized as possible. I started highlighting the key quotes and points I needed in my paper. I then took them and grouped them into the 9 different categories that were required. After that I grouped them into different paragraphs, then looking at the points in the paragraph I looked at which ones to move. Throughout the months of writing the paper my English teacher would have a peer review session to have each other to look over out papers because it is against the rules to have him look at it. These peer review sessions would help me a lot because sometimes what I thought makes sense doesn't always make sense to other people. In the future I hope to work on this skill and help make my writing even better. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Stokely Scarlett ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus mainly on the organization when doing a piece of writing because it gives a better guide and understanding to the writers and readers. Organizing my writing gives clear communication and it helps to gather and send out the right information. Creating a thesis is the first step in organizing my writing. By doing this, it develops ideas that I will be able to use to expand my body paragraphs. Throughout my high school English language writing experience, my teacher normally gives feedback on the way I structure my paragraphs and offer ways to make it less confusing. For instance, the ELA state regent, I was able to process my claim and make my argument by having a structure. First I made my claim followed by the counterclaim and the evidence that supports that counterclaim. Then I made my rebuttal with strong statistical evidence that made my claim stronger than the opposing claim.\ In my future writings, I\'d like to focus more on my transition from one paragraph to the next. Keeping the readers refreshed about what happened in the previous paragraph, and updated about what will happen in the next. I believe I also have space to learn how to paraphrase and analyze the work of a specific source. Not being dependent on their words, but having the ability to incorporate a meaning in what they are emphasizing, making it less than a summary and more of an argument. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Amanda Schaller ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a student in high school, writing was always something that I enjoyed doing and was relatively decent at. Something I always excelled at was creating a strong thesis statement that fully summarized the following paper. In 11th grade, my English teacher gave us a template to create perfect thesis. The template went as follows; transition, counter argument, subject, opinion, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[because of]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ then two to three reasons. Before I was given this template, it used to take me the longest to write my thesis, and usually my first few attempts were discarded. To put the template in use, you would insert the correct information based on the topic of the paper you are writing. For example, in 11th grade, the topic I was writing about was whether SAT scores are an effective way of judging students. Using the template thesis would sound something like this, Although the SAT has been used for years to measure intelligence and readiness for college, the SAT is no longer the best way for students to be judged upon because many students are now being diagnosed anxiety problems which can make their test scores an inaccurate representation of their abilities. In addition, all kids are required to take the same SAT even though they may not have taken all the classes to be successful. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward, something that I would like to focus on is my sentence structure and my grammar. I tend to have lots of run on sentences and have lots of doubts about whether a sentence is structurally sound. I know that with writing the best thing to do is to practice writing and get critics and corrections. That is what I hope to get out of both my INTD classes regarding my sentence structure. Grammar goes hand in hand with sentence structure, which is why it is another thing I would like to work on as a writer. Many times I struggle with what words to put in a sentence, in which order and where the comma goes.I hope eventually with enough practice it will start to come more naturally to me. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nick Schiotis =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I believe one aspect of writing that I focus on consciously while I revise my draft is fluidity. The ability to flow in writing and successfully transition between different ideas and concepts makes a writing piece thrive. If a piece of writing fails at flowing effectively it is very noticeable and diminishes the value of the work. The idea of fluidity was taught to me after an English teacher of mine handed me a paper with "See me after class written on it". This teacher explained to me that my essay was overall a disaster and needed guidance. This humiliating yet enlightening event is what built the foundations for my focus on fluidity. I attempt to maintain fluidity throughout my writings by setting up an outline beforehand and focusing on connecting the endings of body paragraphs with the start of the next. An example of this is when I was writing my last research paper for my Art History class. This paper was based on my experience of the Brooklyn Museum and a specific piece that stood out to me. An example of my ability to flow effectively from one body paragraph to another was shown in this piece when I decided to start the paragraph with "The reason for this relief sculpture seeming familiar to me when I first saw it is because of its similar style to many of Italian Renaissance art shown in the text" instead of what I initially had which was "A piece created by Domenico Ghirlandio, another famous Italian Renaissance artist,". The addition of this helped flow and transition effectively because the paragraph before focused on explaining what the Italian Renaissance was and how it was covered during class. An aspect of my writing that I would like to improve is my ability to include quoted sources more effectively. I tend to treat quoted sources as a burden more than a technique to improve my writing. Recently I was taught the 3 different ways of including quoted sources MLA style and hope to incorporate these techniques to further develop myself as a writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ryan Schlote ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Ryan Schlote ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [During high school I struggled to find a writing process that worked for me. It took me up until 12th grade to find out a way to legitimately structure my paragraphs. Although I was able to write better I still struggled with one thing, and that was with my run on thoughts. For a very long time I struggled with meeting the word count on my essays, so over time I inherently developed the strategy of saying the same thing over and over again but in different words. Something I need to do to help it is have my thoughts more specific and concise. My senior year writing teacher finally told me about this habit when underlining all the times I repeated information. An example of this is in my college essay. I wrote my college essay on thrifting, and the essay started out with a description of the store I was describing. Although a description of the setting is important, I began to talk about the store in the same words without even knowing. I don\'t know the exact words but I think I said something like, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[I walk into the thrift store and smell the generic air freshener. It's stale in there.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The thrift smells stale, like nothing". A way I'd change this is if I maybe I said, "Walking into the thrift store brings on a stale stench, almost smelling like nothing". My teachers taught me to be patient with my writing and try not to rush out my thoughts. Something I\'ve learned to do to help control my repetitiveness is to check over my work constantly. I\'ve figured out that if I read my own work out loud to myself it\'s much easier for me to recognize my run on thoughts.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward into college I\'d love to work on adding quotes and more primary sources into my writing. During high school I would add in information I learned from sources by paraphrasing it. It would be in my benefit if I were to add in more quotes and describe how they help develop the claim and the essay.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Isabella Schmitz ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Ella Schmitz 9/10/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self Reflection \#1 INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When composing a paper I mainly focus on instilling a sense of voice into my work because besides having a clear cut thesis to guide the rest of one\'s thoughts, I believe that being able to connect with the reader on a deeper level as if you are talking directly to them enhances not only the understanding of your claims, but the interest level as well. If you fail to engage the reader, eventually you will not have anyone interested in what you have to say because who would waste the time? Although for years my past English teachers have strongly advised against using "I" as a first person pronoun in papers, I struggled avoiding doing so because I found that without adding this, one\'s voice is silenced forcing their work to be generic. In twelfth grade I took AP literature where I began working on my college essay. My teacher encouraged me to make my writing style unique, leaving more than just my name to divide myself from other students. I am now in college taking INTD 105 and on the first day the professor had similar instructions- a sense of voice is a MUST. For instance, our first paper was on my personal life and goals. Granted that this is a very familiar topic, putting it in writing can be challenging. By adding my own spin and voice, the meaning and purpose is intensified. In my introduction I stated, "I am a firm believer that where one comes from and how they were raised are the very factors that yield one to being considered unique thus giving each individual the ability to share with others who they are." I thought it was crucial to start right off the bat speaking in "I" narrative to keep the flow throughout the entire paper as well as further express the importance of the prompt by showing it matters to me.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [After spending much time focusing my revisions on this aspect, I believe I have grown much more confident in my writing. Moving forward, I'd like to master how to create the most concise, yet still clear thesis. A thesis paves the ground for where you go next with your thoughts so its important that the reader knows exactly what you are trying to say. Often times I find myself adding too much detail and ultimately confusing the reader so possibly planning out condensed main points before I begin writing will help consolidate rambling. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christopher Schneider =================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my years of high school, my writing has always been]{data-contrast="auto"}[ a bit more intentional and sophisticated compared ]{data-contrast="auto"}[to other works produced by my peers.

I use these tools as they not only aid in the process of writing the assignment from start to finish, but they also help me understand what I am trying to convey and they help to facilitate the reader's understanding of the argument. If examples from resources are not used, then the argument will, as a whole, not have any support or strength behind it, causing it to be unreliable. This idea also can be used for the method of using alternate perspectives as using the opinions or beliefs of others can help give me a reason to state the evidence on why my argument and/or beliefs are stronger and more supported. These methods I focus on in my writing were largely instilled in me by my 11th and 12th-grade History teachers, as I had to write many research papers answering a question mostly based on a single perspective. Therefore, using examples from historical events and using historians\' perspectives on the topics allowed me to further develop my arguments. An example of where I use said examples and alternate perspectives was in a research argumentative paper on how King Louis XIV's regime was a perfect example of an absolutist regime. To develop my argument, I included historian C.N Trueman's perspective on Russia's Peter the Great being a perfect absolutist by including examples about how controlling the clothing his people wore after he visited the Western World strengthened his absolutist regime. Adding this specific example from an alternate perspective resource allowed me to develop a rebuttal statement, which helped me further develop and support my argument on Louis XIV. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [From here on in my writing courses, one aspect of my writing I would like to develop is to dig even deeper into the argument and to never "scratch the surface" on a piece of supporting evidence or a concept that could help further my argument. I think in most of my writing I sound very repetitive, repeating the same explanations for a piece of evidence or a concept rather than further digging deeper into it. I feel as though my argumentative papers are often supported only by the examples and alternate perspectives that I include rather than my own opinions or more complex explanations.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Word Count: 398]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sabrina Schumacher ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Sabrina Schumacher]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The writing skill that I prioritize the most while writing is imagery. Both my AP Literature and Composition and my AP Language and Composition teachers told me that it's very important for the audience reading my writing to be able to put themselves into my story and be able to visualize what I'm writing as they read it. My teachers also told me that the most effective way to incorporate imagery into my writing is by appealing to all the senses so that the reader can fully embody themselves in my work. I feel that imagery is important for me personally because I am a visual learner, if a story, essay or excerpt that I am reading has vivid details it is much easier for me to gain an understanding of what I am reading. Another reason that I feel imagery is an important skill in writing is because I feel that when I read a piece of writing that is very detailed I get a stronger sense that the writer is more knowledgeable on the topic and cares a lot about what they are writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The last piece of worked writing that I produced ironically is my college essay. In my college essay I used imagery and a lot of details to really express to my readers exactly how I was feeling during the moment that I wrote about. The strongest imagery I had in my college essay was the introduction because I felt it was important to grab my readers attention. "I couldn't stop my legs from shaking; my face was red and my forehead was beaded with sweat. I sat there counting down the seconds. In a room full of people, all I could hear was the sound of my heart beating faster and faster. I looked to the floor then rose to my feet, slowly making my way down the center aisle. My heart was beating out of my chest as I got closer to the front of the room, I could feel the tension rising." This was how I started my college essay. Although I feel my imagery is strong in my writing I am very uncertain about my grammar and how my writing flows, these were always my weak points and I know they are imperative to great writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Michael Schwantner ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of writing I focus on consciously is trying to incorporate better word choice wherever I can. I believe just by replacing simple, or more common words, it can improve my work drastically. Whenever I finish a piece of work, my first revision is to see where I can substitute in stronger language to make my writing sound more sophisticated. For example, instead of saying a word like "pictured" i'll change that to "portrayed" which makes it more appealing. As I write I tend to use words like "also" and "because" a lot since they are easy transition words. As a result of that, in high school I learned something that could combat that would be looking up synonyms for those words such as, "since" or "moreover", so they become less repetitive and my work sounds more intricate. In one of my most recent history papers, I did that same strategy with using better word choice. In my first draft I had, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[During the late 1800s, one of history's greatest activists was born, who would soon bring about a change that would forever forever change societal views". After I read that I knew I could've changed words like "greatest" and "change" to something more like, " During the late 1800s, one of history's most eminent activists was born, who would soon bring about social reform that would forever change societal views". As a result I feel as though that sentence improved by those adjustments alone. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Furthermore, one aspect I would really like to improve would be the fluency of my writing. I find that a lot of times I find myself in a situation where I have my ideas all ready but can't put them down into one fluent piece of work. I feel I have a lot of things I write are either not in order or it doesn't sound correct when revising it.

Throughout high school, I would always dread writing essays purely due to not knowing how I was going to start the essay. I have always been the one who would struggle for a long time just trying to figure out my topic sentence, while the whole class was already on their second and third paragraphs. I would feel as though my topic sentences were dry, boring, and not intriguing to the reader. Teachers in high school have always tried to help me with this problem, and for some reason I just can't grasp the proper way to grab the reader's attention. I wrote my college essay about the way I grew up and I was raised. Starting my essay took me a while due to not being able to come up with a topic sentence that would grab the reader's attention and ultimately get me into college. An example of the topic sentence that I originally had was "All throughout my life, I was raised in a way that was very different from the people who I went to school with." I knew that this wasn't good enough to get me into college or be intriguing enough for someone want to keep reading. I worked with teachers and professors in order to make it much better than it was, but still get my point across. I ended up starting off my essay with a topic sentence that said "I am from Buffalo, New York, a sports town that's known for its chicken wings. I come from an immigrant mother, born and raised in South Africa and later moved to Botswana, Greece and then the United States, as well as a second generation Greek American. Living with parents who did not grow up the same way that the majority of the kids around me, was difficult growing up." I became very confident in the topic sentence that I came up with and I was proud of the dedication that was put into my topic sentence. From now on, I would like to focus on the way I start essays. I want to start putting more time into my topic sentences and not worrying about the pace that I work, compared to other people.

Without a thesis statement, writers like me begin to draw outside the lines on their arguments. I have often struggled in the past in terms of setting up my thoughts. I find myself rambling on and on about my ideas in a sporadic fashion. In eleventh grade, my APLANG teacher advised me to avoid using an \"open\" thesis, rather I should embark on a \"closed\" thesis with three outlined paragraphs to develop my argument. This method improved my essays immensely. Rather then saying, \"In One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, the author develops a foreboding tone using literary devices\...\" I would improve my structure and state \"In One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest, the author uses diction, imagery, and assonance to develop a foreboding tone throughout the chapter.\" Yes, a boring example, however APLANG ceased to astray from literary and rhetorical device essays. Moving forward, this minuscule \"closed\" thesis idea transformed my organization of thoughts and ideas in my essays, and it felt\...great! Confident, my writing became more professional, and I didn\'t shy away from adding randoms spurs of evidence here and there, where this time, it belonged. Each paragraph aligned with the order of my devices, and my teacher no longer had to look longingly for my evidence. Though my essays are structured to the tea, an area I still need to develop is my use of valid diction. My vocabulary is not professional, and I find myself forcing words such as\"on the contrary\" and \"galvanize\" just to spice my writing up a notch. However, when these radical statements and placed next to an everyday vocabulary, my writing sounds out of tune and forced. In order to improve my vocabulary, I need to read more. More articles, more books, more biographies, everything. I\'m excited to see my writing reach its maximum potential with some work and organization. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Devin Seidel ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I typically focus on my diction when it comes to my introductions as that is often the place in essays where I convey the strongest points and the tone of my argument/discussion. When it comes to revision of my drafts, I harp on using the correct words because every word has a distinct connotation which could deter the reader from your true motive if the wrong wording is used. In addition, knowing the difference between how sophisticated a word sounds versus how it adds to the meaning of a sentence, or work, as a whole is a large part of the drafts I create because using larger words does not indicate true understanding if there are far more applicable words for the intended mood. Through my experience with AP,s I have been shown, by my teachers, how to really delve deep into my mind to let words flow but afterwards go back and clean up my work to make sure it means what I intended to make it say. They have been a huge source of guidance as they had really pushed me onto a more independent path. Some examples would include how I started a reply stating, "I am very sorry for the delayed response" and following it with "I am very excited for the opportunity to meet with you". These act as good representations of the attention to pathos as I phrased my sentences in such a way to let the receiver know that I had every intention on responding, I take their time seriously and think it is valuable to both them and I. Areas from which I could develop would be analysis of quoted material -- I don't perceive this as a huge problem but it definitely remains a slight weakness because I occasionally can be caught in the web of just repeating the quote's obvious idea rather than actually analyzing making my work bland. :::
