The following repository entails a portion of my final research project for Methods in Computational Linguistics, taught by Kyle Gorman at the CUNY Graduate Center in Fall 2019.

<strong>Files include</strong>:</br>

<strong>- One</strong> Python programs designed to preprocess, sort, and ennumerate high-frequency word collocations within a considerably large text corpus.  Simply locate the file for the text corpus in the same folder as your script and pass through any relative instance of the program's two input fields to pull bigrams and trigrams.

<strong>- One</strong> dataset meant to document key and value results for higher-end frequencies of n-grams drawn from a text corpus of approximately 150-180K tokens. For instance, this program was originally used to process and analyze between writing samples at around 150-200 words a piece. Concetenated into two files, the DIY analytics pulled from these text corprora can help identify and account for the differentiated learning needs of students enrolled in the writing-intensive online writing courss.

<strong>- Two very large text files in which to concetenate your writing samples.
