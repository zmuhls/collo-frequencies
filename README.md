# Summary:

The following repository entails a portion of my final research project for Methods in Computational Linguistics, taught by Kyle Gorman at the CUNY Graduate Center in Fall 2019.

### Attendant files:

1. Python script designed to preprocess, sort, and ennumerate high-frequency word collocations** within considerably large text corpora. Remember to sitauted your file in the same text directory as where your program lives. Once that' set, kindly wrap quotations around the title of the file that signifies the concetenated text corpus, then pass it through the marked input field for the program to pull the frequency values for bigram and trigram tokens.
3. Distribruted dataset meant to sort the key & value for higher-enoriginally used to process and analyze between writing samples at around 150-200 words a piece. Concetenated into two files, the DIY analytics pulled from these text corprora can help identify and account for the differentiated learning needs of students enrolled in writing-intensive online writing courss.
4. Plain or rich text file for each distributed dataset in need of concetanation.
