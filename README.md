# mining-student-metadiscourse

The following repository entails a portion of my final research project for Methods in Computational Linguistics, led by Kyle Gorman at the CUNY Graduate Center during Fall 2019.
</br>

<strong>Files include</strong>:</br>

<strong>- One</strong> Python program designed to extract the key and value for high-frequency n-grams in one or more corpora. Text files may pass through any relative instance of the program's two discrete functions for bigrams and trigrams.</br>

<strong>- One</strong> dataset documenting key and value results for the highest number of n-grams from two concetenated sets of student self-reflections,  submitted in response to the first assignment for SUNY Geneseo's first-year online writing course. Each corpus amounts to approximately 180k tokens over an aggregate total of 500 student responses.</br>

<strong>- Two</strong> text files of concetenated self-reflections. <em>These have been removed from the repository for data privacy purposes.</em>
