Certain sentences can seem coherent when written but turn out to be choppy or senseless when read back. Word order and choice are essential for solid essay writing. I typically go back through and re-read my work multiple times, sometimes out loud, to make sure all of my sentences make sense and I'm sticking to my theme. Teachers and professors have given me feedback on my work complimenting my syntax and word choice. This strategy helps me achieve higher grades on all of my papers and my teachers and professors have reflected positively on it. I used this strategy when I recently typed an email to my advisor, Del Brown. I re-read it many times to make sure it was professional and the syntax and word choice were on point and Mr. Brown commented on my email saying it was very professional and nice.]{style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"} \ [Throughout my four years at Geneseo, I want to develop the ability to portray my point in a more concise way. I often find that my points are drawn out and wordy and I want to shorten them and give them more purpose.

If the reader is not interested about the thing you are writing about, then they will not enjoy reading it. I believe this is one of the most important things about writing which is why it is one of my top priorities. My high school English teacher taught me that it is easy to capture the reader if I am interested in what I am writing about. Being interested in what I am writing is great because I know how I would get myself interested into the reading so I know what would get most of other readers. My problem is that I have a hard time writing a good hook for something I am not interested in. If it seems boring to me then the reader would probably feel bored as well. I like to read books a lot, and seeing the different ways they hook their readers helped me a little bit but it could still be better. I try to make my writing more interesting or make a good hook by trying to give a lot of detail about my writing, and by making something that would get me interested in it, if I was the one reading it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [At Geneseo, one aspect I would like to develop effectively is focusing on the writing I am doing. I tend to write about information that is not needed, or that should not be, in the writing. I need to focus more on what I am writing and not put in information that is not needed for the assignment or what I am writing for. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Andrew Simon ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Andrew Simon 2/10/19 INTD 106 Self-Reflection I When writing for class one aspect I really try to focus on is the structure of the paper. The way a paper flows is very important in how you get your point across. When focusing on structure, most people already know to put the introduction first and conclusion last. What I was always good at, was when it came to the body paragraphs I make sure that as the teacher reads, their thought process would be smooth and flow well. It is kind of difficult to put a worked example of this, but the way I organize the information in the body paragraphs is by making an outline and organize the basic ideas of the body paragraphs and find out which would be the best way to get the main idea of this paper to the reader. In my most recent paper I had to write about my argument, and i first gave both backgrounds between the two opposing sides, slowly add the problems that eventually rose, and get the reader on my side by showing how why my argument was correct with facts. It\'s quite hard to have an example of this, but I believe this is paraphrased Now I will admit that when it comes to writing the thing I need help with is producing a good thesis. I usually receive insight on to what my thesis should surround, but I still have difficulty coming up with one and devising a sentence from it. This semester I do not think it will be hard to fix this as long as I make an effort to seek out help and do my best in this online class and in my INTD 105. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Liam Marino ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write an academic paper, I am very conscious of maintaining a central idea throughout the paper. Initially the theme is introduced in my first few sentences. I am confident in my ability to not shy away from the main argument of a paper. In order for my papers to be clear, coherent form I reiterate my points and give examples or extend on it. In order to further strengthen the argument I am trying to get off, the theme is repeated and paraphrased. I do this so that if one way of wording it is perceived as confusing, there is another sentence after to further help the reader understand the point I am trying to portray. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Thomas Wollen =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Thomas Wollen]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I find myself always trying to make the opening sentence of any essay I write to be as powerful and intriguing as I can. I do this in an attempt to draw in the reader, and engage them in my writing right at the beginning. When the reader isn\'t engaged, it just becomes another boring piece of writing; And if the opening sentence is weak and boring, it tends to be a reflection of what the rest of the essay will be like. Having the ability to grab your reader right off the start is a very important skill to have. I had an english teacher that would constantly say "The most important sentences in any kind of writing is the first and last sentence". This teacher helped me realize the importance of a strong opening sentence, and throughout his class my ability to write one improved drastically. I found myself rewriting the opening sentence ten to twenty times, until I thought it was good enough. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While I do feel I have the ability to grab a reader\'s attention I feel I may lose them along the way due to my overall writing ability. I have the tendency to write run on sentences, and write like I speak. This sometimes leads to me being grammatically incorrect. I personally feel that writing as a whole is one of my weaknesses, but I don't plan on just giving up. I want to get better at it, and I know with practice I will. I'm very willing to learn and to dedicate time into becoming a better writer.

Teachers in the past have pointed out that I tend to write in a stream of consciousness, something that works well for creative writing but leaves an academic paper seeming disorganized and exhausting. The few academic papers that I have written with very distinct, clear introductions, body paragraphs and endings have all been the result of carefully planning out each paragraph and using an outline in order to organize and sort all of my points and ideas. Thanks to creative writing that I do myself, I know I have a strength in choosing words- syntax- and the actual sentence structure. My past teachers have told me that as well, but they all have told me to work more on the sorting of my points. In my head they can get jumbled. In the future I'd like to focus in on citations. I never really got the hang of how to do certain styles and types of citations, and when doing academic essays and using tons upon tons of sources, citations are a huge deal. If I could learn both which citations to use and how to structure them, I feel my writing prowess would be greatly impacted. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kiara Richmond ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a student when I write I tend to focus more on my evidence and my analysis. Theses two aspect where the tuffies thing I had to do while writing. I used to input evidence into my essay that did not relate with my thesis statement or the idea of the essay as a whole.My high school teacher saw that I was struggling and she developed an outline that would help me organize my ideas. For example. We had a writing assignment to do I rewrote the essay more than three times because I didn\'t want to us the ut line. Due to the fact that I thought it was wasting my time until I actually used it. Once I used it and pot all my information in it ,when I handed in my final essay it was perfect. This skill is important to me because without the outline I would of never been where I am at today. It also helped me develop my writing and the flow of my papers. Alongside with knowing if my evidence correlates with the point im trying to prove. For example, last semester I was struggling with my weekly reflections. I used to get zeros and check mines , which was not the best. The grades indicates that I was fail and it was because my evidence did not make sense with my thesis statement until I started using the outline that my teach developed. Once I used that when I rewrote my first reflection the TA left a comment saying well done and that it was better than the rest and on top of that I have received a check plus. When this skill was first introduced to me I was upset because I saw this outline as a waste of my time. When there was an paper that I was assigned I always tired to get out of completing the outline.As time went one I found out that the outline was my best friend and a very beneficial thing that my teacher created. For instance , the outlince have four to five sections depending on what you are writing for. If you are writing an argumentative essay you will have five different sections which are; Introduction, topic sentence, evidence, analysis, ( is one section by itself) then you repeat the topic sentence, evidence and analysis for one more time. After you are done with the three sections you then have to do your counterclaim with the same format of evidence and analysis. The last step will be to wright your conclusion to the essay. Once you are fully done putting in all the information you can transform the information into a well developed essay. Instead of just copying and passing the information you will have to alberaty on the information to make it flow.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward I will like to develop a better way of expressing my writing with different words. Also I will like to learn new writing techniques that goes down a different path rather than, argumentative essays.Last but not less I want to learn how to develop an paper that sounds like you but not based off the way you talk. Also how to cite websites, articles, books and images in a paper.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} **Thesis**[: Martin Luther King Jr. inspired the community of black people along with some white people with the use of repetition, metaphor, irony, and rhetorical words in his speeches of " I Have A Dream" and "I've Been To The Mountaintop" speeches.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} **Topic sentence**[: Martin Luther King Jr was a well known man in his community and in his father church.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} - [He organized his first major protest of the African American Civil right movement]{style="font-weight: 400;"} - [Bus Boycott was to tell the people in the community and government that black people are not going stand for being treated unfairly amongst the white people ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} - [He became a Civil Right Activist and used nonviolence tactics.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} **Analysis** [: Dr.King as he grew up he took over his father church when he pass.

If there is no creative description within a written piece it would be very dry and hard to get the reader to think or connect with the writing. I am fairly creative in trying to engage and confident in creative descriptions for someone to start thinking, I always had trouble meeting an assignments requirements and organizing a paper but, if I was able to get a reader hooked to kick off an assignment then I as well would be able to understand where I would want to take my writing. Using creative writing helps me explain how I understand contexts of assignments like, " Apartheid time period and give it a personable light tone of the text, allowing a simple description of someone's struggle less seen as a fact stated but characterized". Utilizing concepts of light and dark allow me to tie in examples and complete a full idea. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving on while here in Geneseo I would like to improve in my grammar and in key points, I find myself not getting to the point in which I not only lose myself but the reader and lose the purpose of the paper.

I have always been able to convey my own original ideas and interpretations to the reader while still providing factual evidence and quotes. An example of my voice can be seen here in my essay on African American struggles in the 1900s: \"But what can a rock do? A rock cannot run. A rock cannot fight back against the waves smacking against it. A rock must simply sit there and get hit time after time by the crashing waves. She is using the black rock as a metaphor to show how black people have been forced to sit there and stay silent while taking an emotional and physical beating from the white people in America\". I believe voice is very important because it is a huge distinguishing factor in writing. Without the writer's voice coming out in their writing, the essay becomes quite bland and boring for the reader. By reading different essays that have expressed varying levels of voice I am able to truly understand the impact of the writer really expressing their voice. It gives the reader a sense of connect with the writer as well as a greater interest in what they are writing about. It is for these reasons that I will be working hard on continuing to express my voice in my writing. On the other hand, I have noticed through peer revisions that I am lacking when it comes to spelling and grammar. Spelling is easier to fix but I believe that I need to gain a better understanding of where it is appropriate to put commas. Both of these areas are very important because they affect the flow of the writing as well with how you are being viewed as a writer. For example, bad spelling and grammar may result in the reader feeling as though the writing they are reading was not professionally written. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brandon Johnston ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In revising my writing, I pay particular attention towards word choice, and decide whether alternatives improve the flow of the writing. Repeating a turn of phrase in multiple sentences in a row, is a problem. It implies a lack of creativity on the part of the author, and on a simpler level makes the writing clumsier for the reader. For example, while writing an essay about my genealogy, the words \"my family\" were used twice in a row in my first draft: \"[From my earliest Puritan ancestors, my family has never left the north, leaving their hands clean of the blood of slavery. Multiple famous abolitionists (John Brown and Harriet Beecher Stowe among them) stem from my family\'s bloodline.\" This was a simple fix. By replacing the second use of \"*my family*\" with \"*our*\", I avoid falling into that trap.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, what I want to improve upon most is my very use of revisions. In the past, I haven\'t revised essays every time, instead only doing so for particularly important writings. On most occasions, I revise and modify as I go along, and this has generally worked for me. Now, however, I recognize that this is not a popularly accepted practice, and I feel that I could exponentially improve my writing by revising every time.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nisrine Fettah ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Nisrine Fettah]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Conventions of College Writing]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [September 9, 2018]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Your Writing Priorities]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My strength in writing would be making supporting ideas. I have always been a thinker and throughout my coursework, I have greatly sharpened my critical analysis skills. I find that supporting ideas, through critical analysis and having good reasoning behind them, allow the reader to clearly make their way through my essay. I am also able to fully to point out multiple complexities within a text, instead of sticking to one-sided arguments in my papers. In my essay for abolishing the death penalty based off of the analysis of the book "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamne]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[", I made precise observations to how the death penalty affected the condemned. In my essay, I used the argument "Abolissons la peine de mort definitivement! Pensons a la famille et aux proches du condamne, son execution les transformera en ennemis de la justice". Before writing my essay I tried summarizing each chapter and tried to understand exactly what the author Victor Hugo was trying to reveal about the daily life of a condemned man waiting for his execution. This method permits me to get my ideas organized which makes my essay very straightforward. I attended high school overseas, meaning I developed many of these skills writing in French which leaves me without a good example to present.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Frankly, there are a lot more weaknesses in my writing abilities than there are strengths as I grow as a writer in English. Writing has never been a strength of mine; I tend to easily go off topic and repeat the same sentences in different wording. I truly believe that my writing has greatly improved from freshman year to senior year of high school, but there's so much more room for growth and enhancement. Grammar is very important when it comes to writing because it organizes the sequence of ideas in an acceptable manner, and it is an area I need to improve in. I hope my thoughts will be able to sustain a logical argument in an organized manner now that I'm in INTD 106 and INTD 105. I will be sure to go to the Writing Learning Center in hopes of receiving help to fully improve my writing.

I'm fairly certain now that I can recognize when I need to revise a certain sentence or section, because it's easy to tell when something sounds overdone or cliché. I usually fall victim to merely listing out in an introduction the things I will be discussing in an essay back to back, rather than elaborating upon them in the introduction itself. This is mostly because we were told in high school to briefly touch upon what we'd be talking about in the introduction, and then expand upon it later. This makes my writing lose its lackluster immediately, and makes it become boring or uninteresting to the reader. For example, I would say "Manhire uses allusion, extended metaphor, and repetition in order to achieve a greater impact on the audience". With the guidance I received, it's apparent why this way of writing and presenting information is insufficient. It doesn't explain how the author uses any of the devices listed and doesn't say what the impact on the audience even was. Instead, I would break the sentence apart, elaborating on each device in their own individualized few sentences, and then tie them together by explaining the role they play on the formal aspects of the piece. "Manhire uses allusion within the piece by \_\_\_\_. He also employs extended metaphor by means of \_\_\_\_\...." and so forth. An aspect of writing I would like to develop is being able to write an extensive essay and maintain an original and fresh way of structuring my thoughts and sentences throughout. I'll often try to expand upon an idea but revert back to ways of phrasing that I've already used multiple times before. I want everything I say to sound like a fresh interpretation, even if I'm referring back to something I've touched on before. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Moriah Daniels ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Moriah Daniels In my academic writing, I try to mainly focus on making sure the reader is able to hear my voice in whatever I write. I feel as though if a reader can hear you in your writing they are more likely to understand and relate to the point I am trying to convey. As a young writer, I would always write any sort of formal writing as though it were from a textbook. Since then I have learned that it is easier to grip the reader\'s attention by imputing my own spin on things and adding an anecdote. For instance, the last formal essay I wrote was a paper describing why we do or do not live environmentally friendly and while I was writing it I became bored with the topic. It felt as though I was listing one way after the other of how I was eco-friendly and became repetitive. At that point, I decided to do something a little less conventional and inserted fun examples that someone would recognize in their everyday life. In summary, I inserted a story of how one day I was scrolling through Twitter and saw a video of how straws and plastic were ruining our oceans. Therefore, I made it my mission to get myself and my family on a path of sustainability. In my actual writing, I went on for much longer about how Twitter played a big role in why I am attempting to take on the environmental issues we face in regards to our plastic problem. In my opinion, it brought the work to life instead of it being another boring paper listing out ways about why I am the way I am. In the end, my teacher appreciated my work and even told me how it was an enjoyable one to read. Since then, I have tried to never bore any reader that may have seen my work. As I proceed in improving my writing in my academic journey, I would like to focus not avoiding the use of too much passive voice. Indeed in some cases, passive voice may help, but I would like to try to find a different way to get my point across without always having to use it. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ian Ward ====================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Ian Ward ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2-9-19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [When writing any form of response, argument, or thought my writing style remains similar with a focus on writing exactly as the thoughts flow through my mind.

One statement an old English professor of mine had made was that I create wonderful vignettes, or small peaks into the view or scope of what I am trying to portray. This, I believe, is mostly due to my practice in poetry and creative writing, yet I have been told I have a way with persuasion as well. One example of my writing used in my portfolio captures my vignettes perfectly: "Making it out the door, I look out at a discolored sky. Street lights burn their orange and white lights through the empty avenue. Snow blankets the curbs left rotting in its pure color. The world seems to have the best way of making sure that innocence is destroyed. Street sides, paved in ice, try to trip me with every chance they get". The alignment of how I organize my topics and where each phrase is placed contributes to the best parts of my work, along with the Ethos, Pathos, and Logos in addition. Another example is best shown through one article I wrote on climate change: "Just imagine, by the time it takes to graduate, own a home, and account for your first child, the sea level will rise from your ankles to your knees".]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The parts of my writing that I believe might need some fixing up are mostly in the category of grammar. I tend to leave out commas or place them in parts of sentences without a necessary cause. I also need to educate myself on words that are similar, such as "their" and "they're". Generally speaking, I need to focus on the specifics to get better, rather than the general points I am making throughout my writing. By doing this, I\'ll be able to get my message across to the reader. I'll be able to communicate clearly by using the correct punctuation and conjunctions. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One other minor problem I have in some cases is changing my points of view. While speaking in the second person, I will change to first, and the other way around. I most likely do this due to the fact I write from a stream of consciousness more than a structured and planned mindset when preparing essays. It's easier for me to talk in the first person because it's how I think while writing thoughts down on paper. I think the best way to make sure my perspectives are kept the same, is to create a mindset off the basis of the topic. If writing from the second point of view, I need to learn to stick with how I am deciding to write. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gwenyth Shepardson ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I write academically one of the main things I aim to focus on is how smoothly my writing flows. This is important because it helps the reader to follow along and stay engaged. If there is no transition between thoughts in writing, the reader can find themselves confused or lost. For example, when transitioning to a point or idea that contradicts or opposes something previously stated, use phrases like 'however', 'on the other hand', 'furthermore', or 'the opposing argument claims'. An example from my own writing uses the word "however" to expand on a point. In a question about using quotations on my "Syllabus, Writing, and Citations Take-Home Test" for Sociology 100, I use the word to further explain my point. I wrote, "For example, if a student were to use a line from a textbook it should appear something like this: Christopher Pieper states in The Sociological Vision, "In essence, sociology is the science of human social behavior at all levels" (2016: 2). However, if parts of a direct quote are left out, three consecutive periods, also known as an ellipse, must take the place of the omitted words". In this case, I used "however" to further explain how to properly use certain mechanics in writing. To avoid disorganized writing, I will read through my work several times to ensure it flows. If I come across something where I have to think, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[how does this relate to that?]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, then I know I must fix the transition to ensure it is understandable. While I find this very helpful, I often include an outside opinion while editing. Having a fresh set of eyes read through my writing is crucial because they may often find mistakes I could have easily read over. Further, if other readers can follow my thoughts in my writing, it gives me the confidence that I have succeeded in the assignment. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In future writing, I hope to improve on creating direct and concise thoughts that get my point clearly across. It is so important in all forms of writing to make sure your ideas are clear. The use of unnecessary content or words can mislead the reader and cause your point to get lost. In previous pieces of mine, I have struggled with this. Whether it is to meet a page or word count I have often found myself including things that my papers can easily do without. Expanding on main ideas in a paper with valuable information rather than simply rephrasing ideas already stated can help lead to stronger writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Harry Radke ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Writing has never been one of my strengths throughout my academic career. Although there are many aspects of my writing that I constantly stay on top of, one aspect is making sure everything flows in my writing. During my high school career my teachers would point out that my writing was a bit scattered and that I need to make sure that I organize my writing. When I revise my writing, I always read it out loud to myself to make sure that when I hear it, it all makes sense. I learned this from my writing teacher in high school, he sat me down and said, "Read this aloud to me and every time you need to pause because something doesn't make sense, mark it and go back to it.". This was a simple fix to a major problem and because of this advice my writing is smoother than it was in the past. So far, this tactic has developed my writing into something I wouldn't say is great, but definitely led to major improvements. As time went on, I wasn't receiving comments on my papers that they were a mess, I was receiving positive feedback outlining that my writing was more complete. I recently did peer editing in my INTD class on a summary of the reading *Up From Slavery,* by Booker T. Washington, and the first time I read my peers paper I read it to myself. The second time I read my peers paper, I read it aloud and realized there were many grammatical mistakes. This is just one most recent example of me using this skill to better my writing. As stated in the previous paragraph, my writing still needs a lot of improvement and one aspect that I would like to develop effectively in Geneseo and beyond is understanding when to start a new paragraph and when to end a paragraph. There is something about the organization of paragraphs that I previously struggled with and still do to this day. I have always known that I struggled with this aspect of writing and have never known how to improve it. If i'm able to understand this aspect I believe it will help my writing tremendously. Personally, I look forward to becoming the writer I never thought I could once be. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Timothy Vartigian =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Timothy Vartigian In my writing I consciously focus on giving myself a voice. I believe this is important in writing because the reader has to feel that they can connect to the writer. Once that is accomplished the understanding of the writing is much easier because you know what kind of person the author is. Also, it makes the piece more interesting in the sense that you are almost listening to someone, rather then just reading empty words. Many teachers throughout high school have given me constructive feedback that has shaped me into this type of writer. Specifically, my eleventh grade teacher would often express the importance of finding your voice in your writings. The draft and revision process is also very important to me in making sure that the final draft is neat and the best I can possibly make it. First, I will take a quick glance at the entire paper and make sure the paragraphs are the sizes I want them to be and never too run-on or cut short. After that I will read it out loud, which is where I will fix most of my grammar mistakes and make sure the voice and context of the essay is what I want it to be. Finally, I will read it one more time to make sure everything is perfect and to get an overall feel of the writing. I am very open and exited to learning more skills in my writing. I feel that these new skills could improve my writing tremendously and having the ability to write and persuade well is really important to me. One aspect of my writing that I would like to develop is getting to the point I am trying to prove quicker. A lot of the time I will beat around the bush by using broad statements and not putting enough facts and evidence into the writing. Ways I could do this is by just writing more and try to consciously focus and ask myself if I am getting to the point. I hope as I continue writing here at Geneseo and even after I graduate that I can develop this skill and become the best writer I can.

I make sure that it comes across as clear as possible by using the appropriate diction or by taking a hard stance on the issue. Another thing that I focus on, is evidence. I try and make sure that the evidence logically flows. I do these two things because I have learned throughout the years that I can\'t think and then write. I have to write to think. I\'ve thought about it in this way because in order to be able to have an idea that is worthy of presenting it needs to be grounded in logic in some form or way. The only way one could do that in a formalized way is through the process of physically writing and reading. This allows for the evidence for the argument to flow smoothly since the idea has already been grounded in some logic that has been expressed in the piece that one is writing. an example of this can be seen in my compare and contrast essay for INTD 105. I state, \"[The passing of the emancipation proclamation marked a drastic broadening to the definition and application of the word liberty. After a simple signature, African Americans across the entire nation were forced to taste the bittersweet cake of the choice.\" I thought this was a good example of me making a strong claim while using good diction and its pretty easy to find evidence supporting this claim since the Idea is centered around a pretty agreeable claim. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} I would like to be able to write in a way that is valuable.

The award Markus Zusak had won was the Margaret A. Awards in 2014. The Margaret A. Award is awarded to an author for his work that provides a long lasting effect on the young adult genre. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The Book Thief]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ is spoken through Death's point of view, which brings new types of discussions. Within the novel, Death would foreshadow certain events in the novel that the characters themselves would not have realized was going to happen. Death would also give the opinions of multiple people within the novel so that the reader would understand and see what each character is like. Another unique element that Death provides is his own actions that he takes in the novel. Most commonly, we see Death as an evil entity that would take the lives of loved ones or as something inevitable that certain people try and avoid. Within the novel, Death can portrayed as a savior to the people that had passed, as if someone that relieved the pain from someone so they can move on to their next life, heaven, hell, etc. depending on your perspective on what happens after you die. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Markus Zusak had used his parent's perspectives and stories within the book along with historical facts that he had researched to make his novel more accurate based on the historical time period. Zusak had spoken within the novel how certain students were sent to a Hitler Youth school for education and etc.. There were incidents were HItler's soldiers would round up German citizens disregarding their age to have them join the army for the war that was going on. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [With all this in mind, Markus Zusak was able to construct a novel that was engaging and informative to the young adult genre as a whole. The novel starts off with the main character, Liesel, experiencing a tragic funeral of a loved one at a very young age. Soon after this experience, Liesel was tossed into the foster care system to be adopted by a new family. With these new important experiences, the reader sees a massive development to Liesel as a character. Liesel starts off as a young teenager that was unable to read or write with little to no experiences on the world around her into an impressive young woman with a maturity past her age. Having to experience the death of her loved ones, trying to stay alive in the cruel world around her during one of the two world wars that had occured, to harboring a Jewish person which at the time was viewed as a crime that was punishable by death.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [With the novel having a vast amount of information for the reader, there are common themes that can be interpreted from the novel. Some of these themes are love, relationships, and culture norms. Relationships are something everyone experiences, from having a relationship with something important to some as complicated as a relationship with another person. In ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The Book Thief]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[, relationship is a theme that is constantly referred to throughout the novel. Throughout the novel, the reader would see an important and unique relationship between Liesel and Hans Hubermann. Hans is Liesel's foster father, even though Hans had just entered her life right after she had to experience the death of her brother on the train. Hans is seen as a kind and caring man, he even had helped Liesel learn how to read and write. These lessons greatly improved her skills in school, Liesel started as almost a dunce to becoming what she always dreamt of, someone who can read and write her own stories, an author. Hans had also helped with Liesel's nightmares of continuously witnessing the death of her brother. When Hans had gone through other issues in his life, such as his political opinion during the time. Later on in the novel, Hans had also given gifts to Liesel for "Christmas" which were books, these gifts allowed her to improve her skills in school. Hans and Liesel's relationship isn't the only one of love, Liesel had another relationship with Rudy. Rudy was Liesel's best friend, throughout the novel, they had done many things together, playing soccer with the neighborhood children, stealing apples, to giving the apple to the less fortunate, etc. The relationship Liesel and Rudy had is something that each and every single one of us have, a true friendship. Their friendship lasted all the way to the end of novel and more. Relationship was not the only theme that was shown in the novel. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Another theme that was in the novel was love. Love is something that most people understand, either regarding to loving a type of food to loving an activity or object to something as simple but complicated the love for another person. The love that Liesel had for Hans is the same kind of love that a daughter would have for their real dad. Hans not only has given Liesel so much love, but also has scolded her when Liesel had gone against his wishes. Another figure that showed love to Liesel was Frau Hermann. Frau was the wife of the mayor of the town Liesel resided in, Frau would frequently let Liesel read in her library even after the Hermanns had to quit their usual dry cleaning from Rosa Hubermann, Liesel's foster mother. The love that was provided from both characters within the novel allowed Liesel to excel and find her own path in life. Love and relationships were two types of themes that were used in the novel, but there are others as well such as cultural norms. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Within the novel, the time period was set right before and during World War 2 which allows us to see how the war affected the citizens of Germany. Within the novel the reader witnesses how politics affected Hans, Hans is seen as a righteous person, someone that always does the right thing. Hans had to choose between from doing what's right vs. serving his country. Towards the end of the novel, Hans had joined the Nazi regime to join the fight when the soldiers had came into their town. The same instant has happened before with Rudy's father, Rudy's father had joined the war so that Rudy wouldn't have been drafted. Throughout the novel, the reader sees that the war is always referenced to the war that was going on.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The Book Thief is a great read that any young adult should read.

I find clarity important because what's the point of writing if you can't convey what you want to say clearly. Imagine all of the popular authors to this day, we love their stories not just because we get pulled into their stories, but we understand what the author is trying to tell us. I find trying to make my writing clear can help in several different types of writing. Some types of these writings include college essays or some odd ones people may not always know about, statistics. In statistics, the primary knowledge you need is the formulas and understand the situation you're presented. In the end of after you have all of the information, you need to know how to write out what you had done to get to your answer and why you're answer is correct. Clarity to me is one of the most important things you need in writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [What I would like to improve on is knowing how to engage a reader to get pulled into my stories.

I used to be like that, I would just hand in a paper without looking it over at all because I was just so happy to be done with it. But one of my teacher's in high school told me that I needed to because the paper looks sloppy if you do not revise it. In an older paper i wrote, "There are three thing I am thinking of as I step onto the spacecraft." Is is a good example because in the sentence I wrote "thing" but I should have wrote "things".

While this is a relatively easy aspect of writing it is what I have struggled with the most is my life. I was born with dyslexia and while it down not affect my ability to form ideas or structure my paper I have always handed in paper with minor grammatical errors. I have found that if i re read my paper out loud to myself the words that I need to change will make themselves evident. The last time i did this was on a report for my American politics class where I responded on a new bill that has been created to make a single pay universal healthcare. In this essay I had to fix a wide verity of grammatical errors. I use terminal to catch any easy mistakes. Examples of this involve changing it to is. Another aspect I look at when Im re-reading is my comma. One of my favorite sentence to use in a paper is. Personally, the \_\_\_ and frankly \_\_\_. I have to add the comma and make sure my independent and dependent clauses are properly separated. In my high school I would meet with teachers weekly to help me revise my papers in the way I have mentioned. I feel the next big step for my writing would be for me to be able to develop a more formal tone. I mean a few things by this. My writing always seems to be about what a think. While this is not necessarily bad I tend to bring myself into my writing too much. I use world like I think and I feel when I should directly address what my ideas are. I also add my opinions too early on in essay I need to first establish facts before laying out my position. I need to find a better balance of opinion linked with facts. I also want to improve on my improve on my ability to find formal sources and respond to them. Most of my writing involve pathos and logos. I try to appeal to people\'s emotions through logic.

Most often people tend to to remember most clearly the points they read last, and it is also a chance where you can remind your reader your thesis or the central idea in a somewhat different way than how I earlier presented it in my essay. I used to struggle with writing conclusions because it always felt like I was running out of steam and I had said everything I already had to say. Most of the time when I go to my conclusion I just wanted to try to finish as quick as possible. My high school college composition teacher taught me ways to avoid being redundant or ending my conclusions on an off subject tangent by trying to save some compelling statistics, quotation, or details for the end. I also had to make sure that these interesting items fits the conclusion as well as the essays body containing sufficient support without it. My senior year I was taught to ignore to cookie cutter conclusion template phrases like "In sum," or "This paper has shown that..." but rather achieve a sense of "round off" by returning to an image, idea, or anecdote from my introduction. Since working on these improvements and trying to develop better conclusions an example of a way I ended my paper was \"[This research can be useful for parents, especially ones living in poverty or environments where their children can be experiencing instability and chaos, that nurturing the healthy development of infants and children is very important. It is now understood that the stress that parents feel can in turn elevate the stress levels of the children in their care, in ways that can undermine the children's mental health and intellectual development.This process can be reversed, often with relatively simple and low-cost interventions.

It is extremely hard to advance as a nation when you are constantly being hit with natural disasters. "Since 1998 Haiti has been hit with 10 hurricanes and other tropical storms,"(Ufondwa). This has caused many deaths and damage to Haiti's infrastructure. Haiti also sits on two tectonic plates causing it to have mass earthquakes. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti was one of the worst natural disasters the nation has ever seen. Causing over 230,000 deaths, another 300,000 were injured, and 1.5 million people were displaced. These natural disasters do nothing but harm towards these nations. They destroy homes, and other infrastructure that cost Haiti mass amounts of money, each natural disaster causes over a billion dollars in damages. They also affect other foreign nations that provide them with foreign aid. These disasters keep putting Haiti's government in a huge hole as it tries to advance.

As a way of preventing this I usually read my completed papers out loud to myself or a peer in an attempt to catch these amiss sentences. For example, this sentence: \"The soccer ball, more properly known to the world as the Football, is a simple technology, it's merely an inflated ball, covered in real or synthetic leather.\" I revised it as this after reading it out loud and realizing it was a comma splice: \"The soccer ball, more properly known to the world as the Football, is a simple technology. It's merely an inflated ball covered in real or synthetic leather kicked around a soccer field to be put in a net to score goals\".

I tend to focus on this because it will affect the believability of my claims and ultimately my final grade for the project or writing assignment. Writing in a professional and serious way will also affect potential career opportunities in the future so I view it as extra important. I will always remember the remarks that my senior year English teacher left on my first essay that I had wrote for his class. He wrote on the last page of my essay "This was some of the best writing I have seen in my twenty years of teaching. There is one small problem, you need to write and talk to me like I am your teacher, not like I am your buddy on the football field." Looking back on my writing from before I had this teacher and received this feedback I would use words or slang phrases that did show the reader that I was supposed to be writing in a professional manner. After receiving this feedback and realizing my mistakes I changed my writing style and word choice to more accurately reflect my writing skill and situation I was writing about. One example I have of this situation appearing in my writing was in an email last semester that I was writing to a professor to ask for a extension on a paper. I remember reading through the email before I sent it and that it sounded more like a text I would send a friend than a professional request I was sending to a professor, I specifically remember one line from the original email had said " Hello Professor do you think it would be okay if I had a some extra time to finish the paper". After realizing my mistake I deleted several lines including the one I previously mentioned, I remember replacing that line with "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[I am hoping some leniency, any at all, can be extended to me in terms of the Paper due date". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ I kept in mind what my English teacher from senior year had told me as I rewrote the email and I sent once I believed that I was using appropriate words and phrasing.

I have practiced and still do developing my skills in writing a good transition paragraph being able to go on from one topic to the next smoothly and without having the reader confused allowing them to process where the paper is taking them. I believe having a good transition in your paper goes a long way in allowing the reader to keep focused and them wanting more. With this, it keeps them on their toes and gives them more of an urge to keep reading the paper. However, I am still learning to progress in my writing ability which I hope to learn more about this semester. In one of my papers I use transtion to contiune to keep the reader ingaged. [\"It was the gods' according to Antigone that had her bury her brother Polyneices and for her to rebel against Creon stating that he has no right to go against the gods'. However, Creon believes that he does have the power to do so.\" In this essay I discuss the actions and beleifs that Antigone and Creon disagree on in the story *Antigone. *]{style="font-weight: 400;"} I have never been good at gathering information and creating multiple paragraphs. I have always used the information/evidence and create a 6-8 page paper. I need to concentrate on the evidence that is given or the idea of my paper and construct a multiple page paper for the essays and drafts that I will be writing for this semester. And with the aspect of having to add more pages to that allowing more information to my drafts, it also allows me to focus on perfecting writing transition to my paper. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Triaszin ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} <div> Paper View Plain Text View </div> ::: {#submission_preview .paper .user_content .enhanced} I mostly focus on concision and understandability when writing academic papers, as I previously had a consistency problems with both concision and understandability. Previously, I would either "overwrite" leading to confusing sentences and wording, or "underwrite" and lead to dry, uninteresting and simply unintelligent writing. Writing, being necessary for human communication, should be able to both keep the attention of an audience while also not driving an audience away with complexity. I first became aware that my writing was inconsistent at the best of times my sophomore year of high school, where, with the help of my teacher, eventually my writing proved to be acceptable. Throughout high school my writing progressed till it eventually started to develop its own character, and, at least according to my progress in the grading of my essays also seemingly much improved. While my writing has significantly improved since high school, I am fully aware that I can still be better at being concise, especially in a grammatical sense. I have a tendency to use run-ons and other errors of the sort. For example, when writing my final for History 207: US History From 1945, I distinctly recall writing a paragraph on the Black Panthers which was both a whole page in length, but only two sentences, with what must have been 4 or 5 commas. I hope to continue to improve my writing throughout my time not only in this case, but also throughout my undergraduate and later graduate studies. ::: ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Janel Stuve ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of my academic writing that I need to focus on my grammar when completing my essays. I personally had trouble with grammar because it never came easy for me to understand why it was supposed to be written as is. My middle school English teacher really thought me the background knowledge on why grammar is necessary and taught a certain way. For example, many great writers probably have little explicit knowledge of how the language works, but intuitively they play with grammar all the time. They can dip into a broad repertoire of implicit language knowledge, and make deliberate choices in their writing. For example, they know when they start their sentence with words about where (adverbial phrases) rather than who, that their reader will be pulled into the setting rather than focused immediately on the character. High school teacher would leave comments on past papers given to me the reason behind why it needed to be written this way. This skill is important because without proper grammar your entire paper can be misunderstood. Some evidence on why I need to fix my grammar was I had trouble figuring out where I need to place commas in compound sentences and trouble with comma splices. When it comes to learning skills indefinitely depends on the subject. Personally I find it harder to learn things like grammar were you have to know if different occasions to use commas; however, when it comes to knowing something that is always going to be used in certain aspects, I can retain that information better.\ Areas that I need to develop but not limited to are tone and word choice. Possible suggestions are that I need to use words that fit better in my essays that are not just plain vanilla words. I need to expand my vocab and use different words that are eye-catching and bring in the readers. My tone in different essays very throughout the pages. Most of the time I stay on track with the correct tones, but other times I jump from a sad tone to a happy tone when it's not needed, or is the incorrect tone. Some possible suggestions could be to check through the essay multiple times throughout the writing process. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gabriel Stash =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Hi there, sorry about that.

Without identifying the thesis in the beginning or the message my papers tend to seem unorganized and are hard to follow. By identifying the thesis and building my paper around it it makes it easier to both write and interpret. For example if I started a paper where my thesis came towards the end or I never clearly stated one the paper loses meaning although if I started it off in my introduction it would be much easier. The skill is important in learning how to construct a decent paper that does not have a confusing message. My teacher in high school helped me dive into this aspect of writing after I first struggled with creating a proper thesis. An example of a thesis is \"While Thomas Jefferson won the election his years in politics were met with the opposing force of Alexander Hamilton who represented the other political party.\" This thesis clearly states what the paper will consist of and also gives background to the main idea in a clear and coherent manner. I am very open to learning new skills to better my writing and hope to become a better writer by educating myself and taking more writing classes. The area I need to focus on in writing is my grammar. I have always had a hard time understanding grammar since grade school. However I have tried to adapt more and learn more about the ins and outs of grammar when writing. I hope to become better at writing through my quest to learn grammar on a deeper level. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jake Sikorski =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Jake Sikorski INTD 106: Conventions of Writing Dr. Paku 10 February 2019 Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities As a writer, I have been mindful of the precision of my words. Trying to find the right words to convey a message, while not being superfluous has been an ongoing struggle. On this topic, Dr. Oberg told me to think about each word as costing five dollars. It's logical to not want to pay for more than is necessary, and therefore it makes you think about what words are and are not needed. Any paper should be clear on the argument that I am trying to make, and precision of language is important in creating that clarity. For example in a recent essay, I wrote, \"The Modoc Tribe lived on a reservation along the California-Oregon border, in Klamath, Oregon.\" When my essay was returned, my professor drew a line through the sentence resulting in: \"the Modoc Tribe lived in Klamath, Oregon.\" I also believe that I need to work on my use of punctuation. From this short writing assignment alone, I am sure it's clear that I'm not as knowledgeable as I should be when it comes to my punctuation. The use of commas, colons, and semicolons has always confused me. This, I feel, is my next step in becoming a good writer. Right now I am reliant upon peer review and the use of Grammarly (an online grammar and spell-check software). Once these skills are improved upon, I believe that my writing will be able to better convey the points of my argument. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kevin Shepardson ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Kevin Shepardson INTD 106 Gillian Paku February 10, 2019 The thing I focus on most when constructing an essay is my thesis. Constructing a solid thesis that lays out the premise and focus of the rest of the essay isn't something I was always good at. How to write strong theses was something my favorite high school english teacher drilled into my head for two years in a row. After having this teacher for English Honors in eleventh grade and then AP Lit in twelfth grade, he had successfully taught me how to develop a strong thesis for any essay prompt. The thesis is the most important part of any essay because it sets up the whole essay and informs the reader what the essay will be about. An unclear thesis, a weak thesis, or a thesis that is too wordy will leave the reader confused and unaffected by the rest of the essay. For example, I used to write rather open-ended theses like \"Ishmael\'s internal struggles contribute to Melville\'s main theme of Moby Dick\" and was able to change them to more structured sentences like \"It is through Ishmael's internal struggles that Melville conveys his meaning that you must not give in to the evils in life and not let depression \'invert\' you.\" Admittedly I am reluctant to learning new things and changing the way I write because I'm generally a stubborn person and I always believe that my style of writing is good enough and doesn't need improvement. Of course I know I'm wrong about this, improvements can always be made, and both my dad and my high school english teacher are big reasons as to how I've changed my writing style for the better in the past. Some things I'd like to change and make better in my writing are how I use references and cite texts. Sometimes I'm not sure how to work in quotes from readings into my writing and I feel as though they sit awkwardly in the middle of my body paragraphs. In short I'd like to learn how to transition into a quote or reference more effectively. I also need to work on run-on sentences. I tend to write run-on sentences in my body paragraphs because sometimes the words just flow out of me and I don't even notice how the long the sentences I'm creating are. Even when I recognize a run-on sentence I struggle with how I'm supposed to split them up and where I should split the one sentence into two. I feel like the areas I want to improve in are not difficult to learn, so I am hopeful that by the end of this semester I'll be the best writer I've ever been. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicole Voci ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Nicole Voci INTD 106 Self-reflection \#1 February 25, 2019 When writing anything formal I tend to focus on a few things. What I naturally focus on the most is my grammar and sentence structure. Whenever I write something I read over it once to check to see if it makes sense and sounds good to read out loud. For example, I wrote an email to a lacrosse coach and the first thing I did was check to see if I had any run-on sentences or sentence fragments. When re-reading the email I found that I had written, \"I just realized that the school wasn\'t a right fit for me and I wanted to be somewhere closer to home where I can go back and forth more easily and have more of a balance between school and lacrosse rather than focusing only on lacrosse.\" This sentence I found to be a run on and I could use punctuation to break it up into different sentences. I read over it again after I fix sentence structure and this time I check my spelling and punctuation. I do this because I was always taught that it doesn't matter what you are saying if your grammar is poor. Spelling and punctuation errors automatically make your work less credible because the mistakes stand out so much. The correct way to have written my sentence from the email to my coach ended up being, \"I realized that the school wasn\'t the right fit for me as I wanted to be closer to home where I get home in a shorter amount of time. I also needed more of a balance between school work and lacrosse.\" This broke up the sentence to make it grammatically correct and sound much better than before. While I do this for a school assignment I also check to make sure all of the requirements asked for by my professor were met. There are a lot of writing skills that I would like to improve. One that stands out to me the most is how sophisticated my language is. I would love for writing to flow for me and have sophisticated language come more naturally to me. I often write with very basic language and have to go back and make changes in order to use more sophisticated language. I would love to get that out of this course. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julianna Schulz ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I try to focus on finding quotes that support my thesis and having a clear and concise analysis. I try to ingrate my quotes using different techniques to keep my writing interesting and to make it flow more smoothly. This is important because it makes it easier for the reader to understand my side of the argument and prove it better. I am confident in my ability to get my ideas across to the reader through my analysis. In my research paper in high school, titled "Criminal Justice: The Move Towards Restorative Justice", I focused on using quotes and paraphrasing to show how the justice system is changing. When my English teacher said that my writing was too simple and repetitive in my structure, she recommended different techniques to make my writing more interesting, and I began to enjoy writing more because it was less boring for me to write if I think about different ways to structure my writing. By using different integration techniques, I helped to keep the reader engaged instead of just having quote, analysis. I think that learning this skill helped me become better at writing because it allowed me to be more creative with my writing. I used quotes by inserting them into my analysis. For example, I wrote, "A type of practice includes family group conferences, in which, when used in juvenile cases, 'about 60 percent of juvenile offenders receive a warning, in which a special police unit may require, for example, an apology to the victim or community service, 30 percent go to conferencing, and 10 percent go to youth court"(Incorporating Restorative and Community Justice Into American Sentencing and Corrections 4). By leading into my quote, I show my reasoning for using the quote and connect the quote into my writing instead of just having it in between my analysis. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [In the future, I would like to work on how long it takes me to actually start writing. Usually, I would spend a long time trying to get my ideas together and finding quotes and by the time I think that I figured out what I want to write, it\'s been two hours and I usually don't stick to my plan anyway. I think if I would get better at just starting to write, I would write faster and better if I would just write in the moment.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cameryn Scali =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I have become increasingly aware in the past few years of writing of my habit to begin to (or to completely) fall off topic. Sometimes I believe this is a product of not allowing myself enough time to write the paper or an ill understand of the material I am writing about. I worked very closely with an English teacher of mine in high school on material he and I both knew I understood but I had lost many points on the essay for falling off topic. He allowed me to rewrite the essay if I looked through my paper with him and, aside from him being an excellent writing teacher, I think that meeting with him really awoke my understanding of that mistake. Since then I will reread sections of my writing multiple times to ensure congruence among not only sentence to the rest of the paragraph but paragraphs to the rest of the essay and the prompt itself. It is hard to pull an example of this without using up a majority of my word count but I have (countless numbers of times) gone on tangents within my writing if I come to a certain part of the essay that I know a lot about, however this may not always be a part of the prompt, nor is it useful information in the context of the essay. I am glad I have become more aware on how to solve this issue but I intend to improve my writing further so I can prevent it before it happens. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Over the course of my time in Geneseo, I hope to become a more captivating writer. I have never struggled to write essays that satisfy their prompts, but I feel my writing could improve significantly if I could enhance my skills as a writer. To become someone whose papers professors want to read. I think the best way for me to do this is allow myself plenty of time to reread and improve my work as well as seek help from others that may be able to guide me. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} **Edit**[: In an essay whose thesis was about non-citizens in the U.S. and their efforts to more than vocalize their opinions I wrote, "One of the most famous, and much later of these events was the March on Washington and Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have a Dream" speech. This speech also mirrors a former political text, Lincoln's "Gettysburg Address", the importance of mirroring in this work is similar to what was done by Stanton." This was off topic because the passivity of Martin Luther King and his followers was not in line with what the essay was asking, it focused on passivity rather than physical attempts at change. I then changed my section on Martin Luther King to discuss the Black Panthers and Malcolm X. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joseph Saxton =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect that I focus on consciously in my writing is providing supporting details for quotes from outside sources that I use in my writing. This is an important skill because it can help to strengthen a claim as well as show the reader that you have a strong understanding of the topic and articles that you are using in your writing. For me this is also skill that I want to develop effectively for my writing at Geneseo and beyond. I saw that this skill needed strengthening when I received feedback from teachers in my INTD-245 class that I took last semester who told me to go more in depth on my descriptions to show a better understanding of the readings in class as well as improving my papers as a whole. This is an example of me using this skill on an essay in my sociology class, "First off, increasing economic inequality is a common theme illustrated in the book. An example of this is seen in Chapter 8: In The House of The Lord, in this chapter Cheri Honkala brings up the facts that there is extreme class bias within the Philadelphia neighborhoods". I then supported it with an example saying "This is true because in the wealthier white Philadelphia neighborhoods there are no churches closed down due to a lack of funding, but in the poor neighborhoods like where St. Francis is located that have higher rates of diversity you see churches being closed down". When I revise one of my essays the first step I take is reading the paper out loud to myself to try to find errors and to decide if a line does not sound right and needs to be changed. Next, I'd have one of my professors read over my writing and provide me with feedback on what I've done well and what aspects can be changed. Lastly, when I revise a paper I usually have another student read over my paper too so I can receive more feedback on my writing and this has helped me to add more of my own supporting details too because I've been told that I tend to summarize quotes or details from the articles I used and it helps me to provide more my own point of view into the writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ana Salazar ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing I mostly focus on making my essays or written pieces follow a certain outline. I try to have a framework that establishes a circular pattern, so it all compliments each other and the reader can better understand what I'm trying to get across. I try to do this before I even start writing. I think it's important to transition into each paragraph softly and connect the main idea of each paragraph to the next. Without this, you just have numerous ideas through your paper that don\'t really make sense and have no purpose. It is important to me to connect most of my ideas to my thesis, or at least have them serve a purpose. An example of this is the following paragraphs that talk about the same topic towards the end end of the first paragraph and throughout the second one. [ \"Cultural differences for a pair of ethnic groups cannot be enough to explain ethnic conflict between the two. Posner (2004), argues that the political salience of a cultural cleavage depends on the sizes of the groups that it defines relative to the country's political competition. He argues that if the cultural cleavage defines groups that are large enough make up useful coalitions that can compete for political power, politicians will mobilize these groups and the cleavage that divided them will become politically salient. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ He uses the tumultuous relations between the Chewas and Tumbukas in Zambia and Malawi. Posner uses a natural experiment to highlight why some African countries experience ethnic polarization and ethnic salience and others don't. The relations between the pair of groups are quite different in each country. In Malawi, the interactions between members of the two communities are frequently antagonistic, seeing each other as political advisories. By contrast, Chewas and Tumbukas in Zambia see each other as political allies and are supported by the same political party.\"]{style="font-weight: 400;"} Something I have noticed that I focus on when I'm writing is trying to make each sentence right and perfect. It is not necessarily a good habit, but I am aware that I do this often. I have noticed that I have a hard time just writing and just letting words flow. I just plan repeatedly and think about what I want to say. Therefore, throughout this course I would like to get comfortable with the idea of revising a paper multiple times because it only makes a paper better. It is an essential process that it is imperative to achieve better writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Taylor Ross ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of my writing that I consciously focus on is stating my topic sentences in concrete, understandable terms. In order to make sure my point is concise, I try to write my paragraphs as if someone is asking me a question. My INTD teacher, Professor Massar, gave me constructive criticism on one of my first essays to get closer to making my point. By using the questioning method, it forces me to continue writing until I feel as though I have answered the question completely. In order to flesh out a paragraph, there must be a strong introduction to the topic. This is where my thesis and topic sentences become crucial to my paper. First, I make a rough outline of what each paragraph should be focused on. If I feel as though my topic sentences are vague or don't express the point I am meeting directly, I go back and revise them so that the reader knows exactly what I am trying to address. An example of the question and answer method would be to take your umbrella topic and phrase each point into questions you want to answer in the writing. So, if I was writing an argument essay where my thesis was supporting the idea of climate change, I would write my outline for each body paragraph with questions. I would use questions like \"what is the evidence of climate change?\", \"how do humans negatively affect the environment?\", \"what will be the end results of climate change?\" etc. This way I will write enough until I feel like I have answered the question thoroughly, making an overall better paper with complete points. In the future, I would like to work on my grammar and sentence structure. I tend to rely on the same sentence structure and the use of commons. I feel as though my syntax can be worked on, as it would make my essays read less repetitive. I have become comfortable in my writing style and feel as though I do not have a tendency to step out of the box in terms of wordplay, sentence structure, or any of those similar aspects. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joshua Rogers =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} <div> Paper View Plain Text View </div> ::: {#submission_preview .paper .user_content .enhanced} One aspect of academic writing that I have recently focused on and worked to become more proficient at is organization, particularly in introductions. In the past, I would follow the basic format of "hook, claim, details, conclusion," which, while functional, was not in any way interesting, and did not satisfy the standards of a college essays. Now, due to the help of a professor I had last semester, I have recognized the benefit of a more thorough introduction. Before, I wrote "In medieval times, pilgrimage was an avenue by which the spiritual could be associated with the tangible," but with my current knowledge, I elaborated on this claim by providing an additional "road-map" detailing all of the arguments I would make throughout the essay. I wrote, \"\...these sources clearly document a wealth of cross-cultural interaction and provide insight into the motivations that drove pilgrims to visit holy sites. Just as well, they elucidate the motivations of the church in making a conscious effort to draw pilgrims in. For these pilgrims, holy sites were alluring because they drew a bridge between the spiritual and the tangible, and provided an opportunity to physically touch and witness religious objects otherwise only spoken of abstractly. The desire to look upon these objects and attain supernatural blessings and healings from them was sought after by pilgrims, and exploited by clergy.\" By explicitly outlining the arguments I am to make in the essay through this method, it allows my writing to be more organized and coherent, as I outline from the start the exact progression which my argument will follow. To continue my writing journey, I would like to learn how to more effectively enter an academic discussion, and combine my own thoughts and research with the surrounding context of ongoing academic debate. I believe that doing this would benefit my writing by integrating it with other academics. Using their insight in tandem with my own would add additional credibility to my arguments. ::: ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jordan Rice ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When it comes to writing one of my strong suits is primarily addressing the opposing side of the subject being discussed. The key thing I focus on is lightly touching the subject so that I can follow that paragraph up with a stronger argument, pushing more in favor of my side. This is an important skill for me because it makes what I am persuading stand out more by coming in and cancelling out the side that I touched on in the first paragraph. I was on the speech and debate team for multiple years during high school and learned this trick from our instructor who is also a language arts teacher for our school. She emphasized this skill when it came to writing and debating for the reason that it jumps out at readers or listeners. An example of this would be political topics. When discussing political topics people tend to do this a lot. This is where a democrat or republican would touch on the other side and then overpower whatever it is that they said with what they are talking about and their thoughts on it. An example of this would be, if a republican was trying to explain why President Trump should build the wall, separating The United States of America from Mexico. One would begin by saying yes, America is a melting pot for all cultures and should let people in, but then come in afterward and say that The United States can still let people in but after papers and processing is done rather than people coming over illegally and then proceed to explain how this is a more organized way to go about this system.\ At the same time that I've tried to perfect this component of my writing there is still a lot more I am open to trying to better my writing. I love to learn new things and apply them to build up my writing more. Some areas I could use some work on include getting more to the point. I have become accustom to going on about topics in my writing with the thought that the more I write the stronger it will be, however a lot of times this is not the case. A "to the point", concise point can be just as strong if not more than going on about the same thing. I also could use some work on my introduction. It takes me awhile to put into words a few sentences about the topic. I think what is going to be important for me as a writer will be to work on main points and how I can support them without overdoing what I am talking about. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Connor Reynolds ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write, most of my time is spent making sure my sentences flow. Personally, I hate when my writing is messy and incoherent. I believe that when everything flows nicely it not only helps the reader enjoy the paper but also makes it easier on my self. It\'s much easier to proofread and make changes when the writing flows. Anytime it seems slow or muddled that\'s the section that needs to be changed. These beliefs all stem from my middle school English class. Back then I wasn\'t very good at structuring my sentences and as a result, I got points taken off that I could have prevented. Luckily I was able to work with my English teacher to fix this. She stressed the importance of proofreading and making sure everything is grammatical. To this day I still spend more time than I care to admit rereading the same sentences. For example in my first draft for my INTD 105 paper i opened my introduction with \"With the current rate of human advancement robots, such as the ones featured in science fiction, might be closer than anyone thinks\". After brooding over that for a while i\'ve changed it to \"As technology advances at ever increasing rates, the debate about the morality of them becomes more and more pressing\". I feel this new sentence is more concise, and gives the reader a better understanding of what the rest of my paper will build up to. My weakest area is definitely my introductions. Throughout my whole academic career, I have struggled to start my essays. I don\'t know why but I have spent hours trying to write an introduction that fit the rest of my essay. Although I spend all that time writing it, its almost always the weakest part of my whole paper. I can\'t even name the last assignment I've submitted thatIi felt confidence in the introduction. In the future, I hope to improve my ability to write introductions. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sara Rapuzzi ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Sara Rapuzzi]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Gillian Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflective Essay \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When cultivating a writing assignment or essay, I primarily focus on the context and providing a clear and developed idea that I can expand on throughout the piece with textual evidence. I feel if I do not have a concise subject that will follow through, the entire essay will then become disorganized and chaotic, restricting the reader from fully being able to comprehend the main theme being argued or relayed. Whilst in my senior year of highschool, my A.P language teacher would produce guidelines and templates for the students to build off of. This aided me in fully being able to achieve creating a work that was able to flow and efficiently provide the topic I'm discussing. For example, the majority of templates given to me for argumentative essays consisted of: an intro, 2-3 body paragraphs, a separate paragraph to refute, and a conclusion. Within the introduction I would announce the topic of what I am discussing, and provide brief examples of what I am trying to prove. Then, in multiple body paragraphs, I build upon the main idea with structured proof, using quotes and citations. In the rebuttal paragraph I would provide the other side of the argument I'm debating, then prove why my argument has more evidence. Closing it out with a conclusion paragraph, I would summarize everything stated in the previous paragraphs and conclude my argument. For example, in a High School english essay I wrote on Buffalo Bill, I ended my essay with a closing paragraph, summarizing everything I have reached upon, while not restating what I have said, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[After a long lifetime of stardom, Buffalo Bill was laid to rest in 1917, January 10th, in Colorado. He was buried there, "\...despite his request that he be interred on his beloved Wyoming ranch" (Etling). He was a forced to be reckoned with, and one of the most well known celebrities in history. While most celebrities today are better known for their plastic surgeries and hunting down the best makeup trends, Buffalo Bill is an icon, hunting down what his name implies."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An aspect of my writing style/techniques I would like to build upon during my time here at Geneseo is my accuracy to be able to further analyze my main ideas. I believe my structure, and grammar also have room to improve. In many of my essays I have been criticized with over-quoting, and not thoroughly analyzing what I am citing. If I am able to understand what I'm quoting, it will be much easier for the reader and myself to fully achieve understanding my written work.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lyndsey Prince ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Something that I already effectively incorporate in my writing at this point is a variety of different words, whether that be adjectives, verbs, or even nouns. I always try to implement strong and interesting vocabulary into my writing as to make it more interesting to readers. For example, when describing a particular piece of writing I would say, \"[Already in the beginning of her essay Oates establishes her differences from other children and even touches on the oblivious nature of her parents. This adds to the uncomfortable and eerie feeling of the entire piece.\" Additionally,]{style="font-weight: 400;"} I am very strong with grammar, I am often the person my friends come to with questions or for proofreading. This, I believe can be accredited to my background with French and Spanish; I believe that learning and studying the grammar rules of the two languages has helped me to recognize the \"why?\" behind a lot of English grammar. For example, my roommate has a true love affair with run-on sentences and I am often the person to tell her \"Hey, those should be separate sentences\" when it comes to sentences like \"I am able to compromise with conflicts and I also get upset when people don\'t appreciate my compromises\". In my opinion this has made it easier for me to pick these things out when I see them. Because of these things, my writing is regularly very strong and well written as far as style and coherence goes. However, something that I do tend to struggle with is explaining my ideas in a way that is easy for readers to understand. I often jump quickly to defending my statement before fully explaining what led me to my argument and why. Professors have told me to work harder with unpacking and making both sides of the argument clear, while giving more details as to how I came up with mine. This is something that I hope both INTD 106 and 105 will be able to help me accomplish. I plan to delve deeper into my ideas during my writing as well as my reading. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sarah Pleines =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I focus on consciously as revise my drafts is making sure I always have a sufficient amount of credible evidence to support my claim. In order to prove my point, I make sure I also have clear and direct evidence to give reason to my paper. You don\'t wan\'t to provide your reader with too much evidence because the idea will get overpowered by the supporting details, you want just the right amount of examples to create a well-thought out theory. With this, I also check to make sure I introduce and explain each piece of outside information thoroughly; My English professor taught us to treat examples like sandwiches, meaning the quote should be surrounded by explanations before and after it is presented. This is an important skill to use when writing because it helps the reader understand why you choose to add the information you include and how it adds strength to your overall argument. In terms of my last couple of pieces, my revision process has started with picking more examples than necessary then dropping some as I realized which ones were not at strong. Then I would introduce them by explaining where they came from and how to connect to the previous statement, then I would insert the text, followed by a concluding thought on what it means and putting an emphasis on its overall correlation to the piece. An example of this would be quoting a piece of literature and ending it with \"That is how that example supports the central idea\", instead of something that actually explains its incorporation. Instead, I would add something like \"This quote portrays Gatsby\'s true intentions for reaching out to Nick and shows how devoted he is to getting Daisy back\". I enjoy learning new writing skills to improve my writing abilities and strengthening my literary pieces. New skills make me feel more confident and sure of what I am writing about. Another writing strategy I would like to develop in Geneseo and beyond is using more literary devices in my works. I believe they have to power to strengthen ideas and spark the interest of the reader. In conclusion, writing strategies and they way they are included into your papers with bring reason, purpose, and structure. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jillian Padavan ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on my voice in whatever it is that I am writing. I am very conscious of how my voice comes across to an audience. Throughout high school, many teachers would critique my writing. They would often note that I sounded too personal and not professional enough. I understand how this can be viewed as a poor writing skill. My AP Language teacher, though, really enjoyed that I had a voice in my writing. She taught me how to keep a personal aspect in my writing without sounding like I was having a casual conversation with my audience. The way I did this was I began to use a thesaurus to replace my casual words with more complex ones. A word I used a lot was "you". In order to rid myself of that habit, I learned how to restructure my thoughts and present my ideas in a more sophisticated way. For example, I would write, "You may think...". I learned to restructure the sentence to, "One may think...". This has really helped to strengthen my writing. In the future, I would like to work on citing more reliable sources. I feel that I am quick to cite any piece of work that somewhat supports my claim. This can lead to unreliable sources and misinformation. I want my writing, especially research papers, to be as factual and reliable as possible. I also want to learn how to do Chicago format. I am very used to MLA but I am aware that I need to know different formats for my educational and real-world career. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ethan Owens ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Ethan Owens 2/26/19 I find myself focusing on the amount of quotes I have in my piece, so that my piece will have a little bit more validity to it. I find it easy initially talking about what the quote means or what I take from it and then attempting to go into a more in-depth analysis. I remember in high school an English teacher always complaining that I only used one quote per paragraph and that kind of stuck with me. I began to become more comfortable with finding quotes that served my purpose and uses two or three in any given paragraph. For example, I had to write an essay about some articles we read about reparations for the suffering caused by interment camps. In all of the paragraphs I used at least three quotes from the source material. In my second paragraph I quote the his redress as monetary compensations. I always try to make my words meld with the quote in order to achieve a seamless transition that is easy to follow. I believe the sentence \"[The other is "the social meanings of Japanese American redress," where he actually means monetary compensation,\" show that i could integrate their words with mine. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} Though I only had one or at most two sentences about analysis after that. As such I do fear that I might be too depended on these quotes and not putting enough deep analysis after words. I would like to work at this lack of quantity and get better at it. Although this is, a concern I have it is not my main concerned, but is does relate. I want to work on the amount of information in my essays, especially concerning the length. I find that when I am writing I, more often than not, write too little and I find myself trying add to it, little by little. For one thing, it is annoying having to keep doing this, but I also feel that it affects the quality of my work, almost as if the professor can tell that I did this and it will decrease my grade accordingly. I want to be able to write more than I have too, not the other way around. I think with practice this will come naturally, maybe making a list beforehand and organizing it there would help as well. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jaynee Osborne ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I try my absolute best to focus on my spelling. With today\'s technologies that is pretty easy, Although I struggle with most aspects of the writing process. I feel that when I was younger I allowed my school to just push my along without stopping and asking for help. I currently have extra software on my computer to help me with my writing and grammar this still is not enough, because most of the time when I am flying through the spell check options I am no longer paying attention to my grammar. The worst thing that has ever happened to me as I wrote a whole paper about angels instead of angles. My paper talked a lot about how \"angles have taught me so much about myself.\" This giant mistake has taught me to always take a couple extra looks over my work. [Having proper writing skills is not only important for me personally and for school but I want to be an elementary school teacher. I have to learn how to make correct sentences if I am planning on teaching young children. I would definitely say that the mechanics of writing are my weakest aspects. I am really good at creating ideas and orally presenting but when it comes to putting it on paper my world falls apart. Every single teacher I have ever had, even math teachers, have told me that I need to focus more on my writing in all aspects. I can stare at an essay for hours and not see any problems with it, they always end up filled with them. I know the basics of writing but I personally do not fully feel I can write at a college level because of my sentence structure.]{style="font-size: 1rem;"} Hopefully, by the time I graduate, I will at least be better at proofreading my own papers.

Over the years I have seen my writing improve but it is still not at the level I would like it to be. Typically when I am writing I mainly focus on my diction as well as my punctuation. When I am going through a draft of one of my writings, I first look at the words I chose and see if I can replace, and improve my diction. I try to do this because writing with better diction can have a bigger impact on a reader, it can leave a more sophisticated feeling to the paper. "College athletes get hundreds of thousands of dollars in the form of scholarships to play the sport they love, and yet they still want more". The word get breaks up the flow of the sentence so going back through I have changed it to "College athletes receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in the form of scholarships to play the sport they love, and yet they still want more". After going through my diction I then see if I had any issues with my punctuation. Whether it be splitting up run-on sentences or putting in commas or semicolons where they are necessary. I do this because in the past my writing tended to have a couple run-on sentences. I've learned from reading peers papers that run-on sentences can often lead to confusion because there is too much trying to be said in one sentence. I look to right concise sentences that do not confuse the reader in any way. If the reader is confused they may lose interest in what they are reading. One aspect of my writing I need to focus in on improving this semester is keeping the reader interested. In my papers I can have a good first half of the paper but as it continues I start to lose strength in my paper. I begin to look at how many words I have to type left and that begins to show in my writing. I need to learn to keep a constant flow of ideas present in my writing and to not have any "dry" spots in my writing. I am eager to increasing my writing ability this semester, and will hopefully improve on the weaker parts of my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Copy of previous work]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Graham Wettersten]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [College athletes get hundreds of thousands of dollars in the form of scholarships to play the sport they love, and yet they still want more. Some collegiate athletes, and fans want the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletics Association) to change their policy to allow the athletes to be paid, on top of the existing scholarships. The NCAA has always shut down any attempt to change the policy that restricts college athletes from being paid. With the increasing revenue of the NCAA, there\'s a bigger gap between the athletes and the organization. But that gap is needed, college athletics is not the pros, if these athletes want to get paid the should attempt to go pro. Even if the NCAA began to pay their athletes they would soon see all the complications in paying the athletes, this is why college athletes should not be paid. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Without a doubt the NCAA makes millions if not billions every year because of college athletics. But should the athletes receive compensation for all the time and effort they put into their sport? Well the NCAA does compensate these athletes with scholarships worth thousands, "NCAA Divisions I and II schools provide more than \$2.9 billion in athletics scholarships annually to more than 150,000 student-athletes" (Scholarships). But on top of this some student-athletes still believe they should be paid on top of his or her scholarship. While the NCAA is profiting off the athletes, "every student who signs a letter of intent or agrees to accept a scholarship to play a sport knows going in that the school\'s job is to make the most money off of his or her efforts" (Pay for Play). How could someone sign this and then ask to be paid? If the athletes don\'t like how the NCAA is run then they don\'t have to be apart of it, no one is forcing any student-athlete to participate in their sport. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [But let's say the NCAA did want to implement a system of payment for the players, how would they do it. Should all Division One basketball players for example be paid the same because they are participating at the same level? If the NCAA tried to implement this not all schools would be able to pay the same amount. Let's take Kentucky for example, a top school for basketball in the country, their average attendance at home games is 23,461 (Kentucky Men\'s Basketball). So maybe the University of Kentucky could afford to pay their players a decent amount from ticket sales and some of the money from broadcasting, but what about the smaller Division One schools? These schools still participate at the same level as Kentucky just have less attendance. For example, Butler a small school in Indiana had an average attendance of 8,357 (Butler's Basketball Attendance). As well as having less attendance Butler does not see as much time on the TV screen. With this in mind how could Butler afford to pay their players the same as Kentucky? Maybe just the top schools should just be able to pay their athletes more but then college athletics has turned into a professional sport.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [If the colleges that were atop the college athletics pedestal could pay their athletes more than other Division One athletes then all of the top athletes out of high school would make their decision based on money. You would see the same teams year after year winning just because they can pay their athletes more so the athletes will attend these top colleges. College basketball would turn into a pay to win sport and all the smaller schools would be left in the dust. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Just because college athletes provide their schools millions of dollars in revenue does not mean they should be compensated for it. No one is making the athletes play, and college is not the pros. If the college athletes want to be paid they should wait for their chance to play at the professional level either after the graduate or leave college early. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [Citations ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["Pay for play isn\'t answer for college athletics." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ESPN.com]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, 12 Sept. 2013, espn.go.com/college-sports/story/\_/id/9666004/pay-play-answer-college-athletics. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [jcoleman\@ncaa.org.

Starting with the basics I have progressively learned how to become a better writer through school and through myself. One factor I believe is key to good writing is an author\'s ability to convey emotion to their audience. It has been one of my main goals within my writing to make the reader care about my point and one way I have accomplished this in the past is to induce emotion in them. By creating situations that evoke sympathetic feeling towards a particular character the reader can better identify with the character and emotion is introduced. For example, topics and situations that most have gone through and understand like puberty or a breakup, allows for them to relate to the text and better understand my main point. In more non fictional writing I have found that using real life examples gives the reader another way to connect to the writing and feel emotion. An example of this is in previous history classes I have found that relating political issues to everyday life instead of keeping them just about politics helps the reader better understand the effects of a certain policy because they see how it can effect them. I most recently used this tactic in a book review for Trevor Noah's "Born a Crime", "The pressures of society that apartheid accentuated through segregation and social intervention affected Noah greatly. Noah\'s search for a sense of belonging is paralleled in the stories and narratives told throughout the book." By framing my argument about about apartheid policy around the social and emotional effects felt by Noah I can better connect to the reader on a more relatable level rather than just explaining the effects of apartheid in terms of politics. Learning these skills has been a process beginning with my teachers criticism and continues as I keep writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of my writing that I believe is my weakest is grammar. Sentence structure, punctuation, and spelling are all factors that I believe leave me room to improve in. I find myself relying on spell and grammar checkers rather than myself and without a computer to write with it can be difficult for me. By writing more and not relying on my computer I will become a better writer. Writing is something I am extremely passionate about and I look forward to improving in. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hailey Niles ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Hailey Niles]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of writing that I have to focus on is organization. Usually when I write an essay I have so many thoughts on the topic that I just start writing them all down. This leads to my essays being all over the place and very unorganized. I need to learn how to revise better and make my thoughts more organized, clear and concise. An example of this was the last essay I wrote. This was my final exam paper in US History last semester. My teacher wrote comments saying that it was a little unorganized. I took his comments into consideration and i know that it is a weak point for me. Something that helps me is going to the writing learning center. They help me organize my essay better. I think part of this struggle starts with the thesis. I usually struggle to come up with a clear thesis right away. This leads me to just start writing all over the place just to get my thoughts flowing. For my final exam in history class my thesis was, "The meaning of freedom has changed over time starting with the colonists longing for freedom from Britain to when the slaves wanted freedom from their owners with freedom having a very different meaning". This thesis only really gives me room to create two good paragraphs. This essay had to be long which meant i needed more paragraphs. This led to my paragraphs being random and based on the same, rather than new ideas. I think it\'s important for me to focus on my thesis writing skills and develop that effectively for my writing at geneseo and beyond. I think a good thesis makes the paper easier to write and easier to organize. I often find it difficult to come up with a thesis right from the beginning and i want to learn better strategies to do that. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brandon Nguyen ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} While writing papers or revising drafts, my main goal is to focus on my thesis statement and how it will embody what I will explain in the later paragraphs. I feel as it is extremely crucial to let the reader know the topic and the main ideas that will be discussed in detail throughout the paper. The thesis statement is the key element to bringing the reader's attention into focus because it will state the validations at hand and show the significance of the essay. When I attended high school, my English teachers would always emphasize the importance of the thesis statement at the end of the introduction. The statement should never contain much detail since the main points and ideas will be explained in the body paragraphs. For example, in one of my past essays, I talked about how Game of Thrones surpasses Breaking Bad when it comes down to iconic television series. I wrote, "Game of Thrones surpasses Breaking Bad because the plot is more complex and in-depth, people can relate to the show in many ways through the characters, and there are various things that make people interested and hooked on the show." The large amount of information produced an awkward and detailed sentence, and the thesis statement was unpleasant to read. After hearing my teacher's input, I finally understood how to make thesis statement clear, concise, and easily identifiable by the reader. I changed my thesis to "Compared to another iconic show, "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones" surpasses it, not only in the sheer number in cult following, but it also proves itself worthy through its plot complexity, appeal to a wider audience through character development, and multiple vices." As I continue to write at Geneseo, I want to keep improving my writing skills and become a better writer than I already am. Not only will this help me with my classes, I will be able to take these skills with me in the future. Certain areas I want to develop are fixing grammatical errors, producing a good, flowing sentence, and having smooth transitions. I feel as though my sentences are not complex enough and they do not flow out of the mouth as well as they should. My transitions also need work because I would catch myself writing a sentence not pertaining to the topic at hand. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joseph Murphy =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} While I write my papers, I try and keep my written work flowing nicely by using punctuation to my advantage. This is important to me because it is my job to try and make the paper as readable as possible. Some of my teachers through the years have explained to me that the easier an essay flows the easier it is for the reader to follow along. An example of this is instead of a section is "I never thought that I would have to do this however the mob told me to follow through with the orders", with the help of using punctuation where it belongs the sentence would look more like this, "I never thought that I would have to do this however, the mob told me to follow through with the orders". They told me that if an essay is choppy with long sentences with no punctuation the reader could get lost and thought that they started a new sentence without realizing it. A skill I want to learn is how to use better vocabulary to enhance my writing. Some other areas that I can develop on is not repeating myself and finding new ways to say what I want to say. Some possibilities that I can take to improve these areas in my writing is have a list of different transitions into paragraphs and other such Other ways that I can improve my writing is that I can look up certain words that I might use too many times and use a synonym in its place. Also, I could look up words that could fit in place for another word. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Marie Moren ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I believe I am skilled in using my voice and personal experiences without them being overbearing in my arguments. I focus on this skill because it helps me to form my thesis in a way that makes sense to me, and then I work off of that thesis building on my arguments through my opinion and voice. Being able to establish that I am the one writing this paper, and my ideas are coming from me is also helpful in avoiding the dreaded concept of plagiarism. Throughout my academic career, I have been praised on my use of voice, without it being too casual. My A.P. English teacher in high school told me once that even if my paper did not have my name on it, he could still tell it was mine. This aspect of writing is especially important to me because it allows me to be a more genuine writer, and I am always striving for honesty and authenticity. A specific example of this is from a paper I wrote for a HUMN class last semester, "At the beginning of book II of ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Consolation of Philosophy]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, Lady Philosophy focuses on fortune and shows that while yes, Boethius is currently in a bit of a pickle, he was blessed by fortune before being imprisoned." While most people would say that using the saying "in a pickle" in a formal paper would be a bad idea, my professor said he found it refreshing. As I am primarily a humanities writer, rooted in history, it is important that I use my tone and voice to portray my findings as my personal interpretations and analysis, not simply fact. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing in my writing that I am not as confident about is revision. I am not always patient enough to write multiple drafts and extensively revise those drafts. I want to become better at writing multiple drafts of a paper and feel confident in my final draft instead of just writing one draft and a final draft and calling it good. Developing this skill is necessary in an academic setting and will take a great deal of will power on my part to kick the habit of impatience. I also hope that developing this skill will make my writing more concise and promote better time management on my part. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Elise Miller ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a student trying to develop her writing, I tend to revise my drafts multiple times while focusing on the flow of my paper. For a long time a struggled with finding the correct flow. Occasionally, my paragraphs would be out of order to the point where they did not completely make sense. During high school, my english teacher worked with me extensively and explained why things worked and why they did not. Over the course of my junior and senior year of high school, I have made it a point to personally review my paper multiple times as well as have another peer review it so make sure things are flowing the way they are supposed to. Looking back at my previous writing, I have realized that one misplaced paragraph throw off the entire tone of a piece. It also may misconstrued the message the writer is trying to portray. As a writer, I put a lot of time and effort into each piece I write and I want everything I am trying to present in each piece.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When given the following prompt, "I]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[n lines 1-99, Antigone and Ismene are having a conversation. What is their conversation about? What view / position does each character advance through this conversation? Why does this matter?" I followed the format given in high school, answer each question in the form of a paragraph in the order given. While I am trying to break the habit of following such a format, I still find myself occasionally reverting to the high school format. To answer the prompt before me, I answered each question as it was presented, which was not the proper way to answer a prompt such as this. When answering the question, "Why does this matter?", I did not give the reader the ability to understand my thesis until the last paragraph due to this sequencing. By using this type of format, I am setting my writing at a disadvantage. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As a developing writer, I recognize the importance of trying to improve writing abilities by learning new skills, even though it may be a challenge. I know it will make me better in the long run as well as take my writing to the next level. As I look to take my writing up a notch, I recognize that I still have things I need to improve upon. I know I need to be more concise and get straight to the point, rather than filling my paper with unnecessary wording. I am looking forward to progressing as a student of academia as well as progressing in an area I am particularly passionate about. I enjoy writing and I am looking forward to getting better. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brendan Miller ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One thing that I try to focus on when writing is setting a good thesis statement in the introduction. I feel that establishing a strong thesis is extremely important because it directly answers the question that was asked of me and sets the reader up for the rest of the piece. One example of a thesis statement that I used is from my Native American History class last semester. "What this is telling us is that people believe that there was no civilization in America until the Europeans settled there. That could not be more wrong. The native people who lived on this land had developed their own ways of civilization and were able to sustain life through those ways." This thesis set the tone for the rest of my paper that Native Americans had a history long before Europeans came to America and that they developed their own way of civilization. Having a strong thesis helps the reader understand what my goal is for the writing and also what key points to look for that help me portray my goals for the piece and that is why it is such an important part of writing. \ One aspect of writing that I would like to try to focus more on and improve it would be voicing my own ideas. I find that in my writing I often use examples and quotes from articles written by experts and other people. I believe that it is good to use these examples from the writing of experts because it shows that I have found solid evidence that supports my thoughts on the idea that I am writing about. However, I believe that I could also incorporate examples that I may find on my own that also support my ideas. I think that by using my own ideas it would really show the reader that I put in the effort to have a strong opinion about the topic. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jackson Michalski =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of essay writing that I pay particularly close attention to is having a consistent tone or "voice" throughout the piece. An important part of making a convincing argument is having a style of prose that's accessible enough for anyone to understand, you want the reader to be able to easily engage with what you're writing. This can be accomplished subtly through the use of adverbs and specific word choice in a text's analysis. For example, in an essay, I wrote about Patricia Highsmith's novel ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Talented Mr. Ripley, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[when describing the titular character I wrote the following: "The rest of the novel features Tom trying to outsmart the police, and despite his devious ways, one can't help but find themselves rooting for him. Watching the absurdity of Tom's schemes and watching him exhibit more and more psychopathic behavior becomes addicting to read." Subtley hiding my own opinions behind phrases like "the reader" instead of "I" helps to get my point across while removing myself from the argument. Many people see writing essays as a chore and use the same mechanical, lifeless formula in every paper they write. In my opinion, making an argument should be genuine and approached in a creative way. One thing my English teachers commented on during my time in high school was the distinct voice I used when writing. I believe that everyone has their own unique way to approach an argument and their own unique voice to argue with, and once a writer figures out how to tap into it they can argue any topic from any position.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As an English major, improving my writing is one of my key goals of attending a university. One part of essay writing that has always been a struggle for me is having a satisfying conclusion. I frequently rely on simply repeating my arguments and leaving it off on an awkward farewell or half baked philosophical comment. I want to work on structuring my conclusions so my arguments resonate with readers and leave them convinced. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Isaiah McNabb =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on the key terms and word choice in my conclusion because I believe that a strong conclusion can impact the reader immensely. I really take pride in making sure my conclusions are precise because I believe it is your last chance to convey the point or argument you are trying to bestow on to your audience. I learned the importance of conclusions from my 8th grade English teacher who gave us an exercise in which we had to convey an argument and get her to understand the argument in one paragraph. Ever sense then I have definitely focused on my conclusions. One example of an effective conclusion I wrote prior to that exercise was: \"While all of the anti-globalist problems I have listed are real I still continue to strongly believe that globalization is good for America and all of the countries around the world because it creates interaction, cultural diversity, the sharing of ideas and technology as well as trade which is a large part of the United States economy. While I do conclude that globalization is good for America, in order for globalization to occur optimally the actions I have listed must take place. Once these actions take place globalization will occur optimally and global advancement for the future of the world and The United States will significantly increase\" This was the conclusion to a final paper I had for my U.S. Foreign policy class where I argued why globalization was good for the United States. An aspect of my writing that I need to work on is my thesis statements and hook sentences in my introductions. I feel this needs work because I fail to catch the interest of my audience in the introduction which could have an impact on how they view the rest of my work. I believe that I need to try to be more creative with my introduction to hook the reader and my thesis statements I have to be more straight to the point so my argument is clear and concise. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jessica Mahoney ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my academic writing, I really like to focus on grabbing the reader's attention, not only in the introduction, but keeping them interested throughout the whole essay. Essays are never fun to read, but if you use intriguing words or facts the reader is able to really enjoy the topic you are talking about more and question their own beliefs about it. In high school, my teachers have always focused on good grammar and getting your point across, but not many of my teachers have focused on a good introduction and good transitions that keeps the author reading. However, one English class I was in had a whole unit devoted to grabbing the reader's attention right from the first sentence with either a question or interesting fact. This has ultimately helped me advance my writing throughout high school and has made my pieces stand out. In INTD 106, we were asked to write an essay about the experience of African Americans in the 20th century. An example from that essay, my first couple of sentences in the introduction is "Imagine growing up in a town of people identical to you. You feel at home and you don't view yourself as anything other than ordinary. However, the minute you step foot outside that comfort zone, you not only feel different, but you are treated differently than these other people. The only thing separating you from them is the color of your skin, but then why are you looked at as someone completely different?". This grabs the reader's attention instead of just stating the thesis and makes them want to keep reading.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I'm interested in improving at Geneseo is the organization of my writing. I feel that sometimes I make a vague claim and then contradict myself throughout my essay, which hurts my scoring. In addition, I stray away from the main point of my essay which can be confusing to the reader. I think planning out my writing beforehand would help me figure out what points I'd like to bring up in each paragraph so it's organized and in sequential order. I am looking forward to expanding my writing capabilities and hopefully come out of this course with new writing techniques.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Allyn Madden ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing, it is important to focus on making your essays and stories more concise and clear. Throughout high school, I was always told to get rid of the "fluff" in my writing because it detracts from the meaning of my words. For example, I specifically remember my English teacher senior year reading my college essay telling me even though the extra sentences I added throughout my writing sounded nice, it was unnecessary and takes the readers' attention away from the point of my writing. Sentences such as, \"[I've been dancing since I was eight, and I remember looking up to the senior dancers, excited to be just like them as a senior,\" did not have a real purpose for being in my writing and it was not needed to get my point across. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}Ever since I was told this piece of advice, I've made sure to compact my writing and edit until I'm sure it says exactly what I need it to. Going back through your writing to edit allows you to cut the unnecessary pieces out and focus on what really needs to be said. Being more specific makes one's writing gets their point across clearer and ensures that the reader does not get bored from reading too many unnecessary sentences. What I understand I need to work on in my writing is citations. When writing things like research essays or persuasive pieces that involve citing others, I tend to accidentally cite the quotes or ideas incorrectly when they are from a source other than a novel. I am okay at citing when it comes to simple things such as novels, but it is easy to forget all the little pieces that are involved in a citation. There are ways to look up how to correctly cite all sources, so this is how I will try to work on this at Geneseo. Being able to correctly cite any type of source- whether it be a novel, website or article- is an important skill to have especially because if you incorrectly cite, that could lead to plagiarism issues. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tyee MacDonnell-Miller ==================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I already focus a lot on the organization of my writing. I believe that the organization of your writing is so important. When I read an article I always find it easier to follow and comprehend the message if it is well organized. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My father taught me how to write and he always emphasized organization. He said that the most important way to start organizing your paper is in the introduction paragraph. Your introductory paragraph should bring up the ideas of your writing in the same order that you will write about them later in your text. My father always calls me out for not organizing my work, so know I always remember to do so properly.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The last paper I organized each point in their own body paragraph starting the organization with my intro. The intro went like this, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Women in America have had a long hard history. They had to fight for their right to vote, they have to fight for equivalent economic status to men, and they have to face unfair judgements from society. Three powerful authors named Jane Addams, Gerald Early, and Joyce Carol Oates journaled the lives of women of their time. The authors Addams, Early, and Oates, conveyed that the experience of many women in the Modern Age was that of hardship caused by men, unfair social standards, and abuse from their family."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I want to learn how to properly use commas. I currently don't know how to use them properly. I think if I could learn how to use a comma my writing would be more fluid. My writing would have a better rhythm with commas. I would also seem to be more coherent and my works would be read and enjoyed by more people.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexander Maccallini ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus most on utilizing rhetorical elements (ethos, pathos, logos) in my writing because I am always concerned with proving the point that I am trying to make. These skills are important in persuasive writing because they appeal to the reader's particular sensibilities, emotions, and understanding of the writers' words as truth. I have an interest in law, and have been on mock trial teams, which helped me form these tools in an attempt to persuade judges and juries. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In mock trial I provide to the simulated court an opening statement, which is an introduction to the facts of the case at hand. In this circumstance, both sides have access to the same facts, but they craft two completely separate arguments based off of them. By using these rhetorical tools, you can persuade the jury to your side before any evidence is actually let in. In my first draft of my statement, before told to do otherwise, I focused more so on the logical aspect, specifically laying out the facts of the case, whereas in my secondary drafts and final products I appealed more to the emotional side of the argument, humanizing the story. She case is about a chimpanzee attack that resulted in a gruesome death, so I make sure to focus on the victim side of the attack. I say, "when he left his house on that day and kissed his wife goodbye, he did it not knowing that it was his final goodbye. The luxury of closure was senselessly taken from him and his family." I also focus on case law, which helps to construct a guideline that the jury needs to follow. I will tell them that because the law states certain president, you must decide in accordance with these rulings. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Continuing on with my academic career, I would like to become more aware of the organization of my writing. Often times I write in an order that is either completely unrelated or only loosely tied. I don't usually think of the piece as a work in whole, but rather a way for me to say what I need to say. Whereas opening statements follow a particular framework of organization, there isn't one set framework for most academic works, which I find challenging. If I become more conscious of the order in which I write, then I will write better as a whole. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Anthony Lyon ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Anthony Lyon]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Professor Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/9/2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My Writing Priorities]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In revising my own academic writing I tend to focus mainly on the trimming of excess information with the intention of making my argument more efficient and more concise. I would say one of my greatest weaknesses in writing is a prevalent lack of brevity, that which tends to steer the paper away from the initial thesis and develop redundancies as I hope to provide ample support for my thesis. I realize, however, that this practice is not necessary and have been working to reduce it. In the twelfth grade, my AP Language and Composition teacher introduced to me the outline as a pre drafting technique in order to create better organized and more streamlined papers, and I believe that if I fully commit to this practice I will ramble less and will hopefully be able to improve my writing overall. This methodology encourages me to focus on only one point of argument at a time as well as fostering a more efficient paper, as I will only translate to my complete drafts the most important theses and pieces of supporting evidence rather than the typical disorganization of undirected writing. Take, for example, the following section of an outline from a narrative essay I wrote about three months ago;]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Mention Canada]{style="font-weight: 400;"} 1. [Originally we were supposed to go to Canada]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [New York City]{style="font-weight: 400;"} 1.

[Bradley and the others are mostly talking outside of me, I am trying to sleep]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An outline such as this one directs me as to how much I should be writing on each topic. The less important bullet points having fewer supporting details indicating that I should spend less time one them and be wary of over-explanation, while the more important bullet points have a greater number, indicating that I should elaborate more on them and be more thorough.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [At Geneseo, I have been working towards and will continue to work towards creating convincing arguments outside of overly extravagant language and hope to achieve a better understanding of the practice of argument in its most basic premises before returning to the use of such language. I found in high school that I would rely heavily on the complexity of my language rather than of the information I was providing. I hope to one day write for a great number of readers, whether that be in politics, philosophy, or in a legal setting, and am concerned that I may be discounted by an apparent lack of substance. I am confident that I will one day reach a point where I can employ effective argument and effective use of language without being so discursive, but will admit that, in that field, I still need some work.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jason Lupp ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I agree with the sample. The introduction is very key to your success with essays and writing successfully. I always focus on the hook in the introduction because that can make or break if the reader is going to continue to read. For example, on my college essay I started with a short anecdotal story that would hook the reader. The story was about an experience I had through hockey which I think would of helped interest my reader. The story began with " The buzzer rang and my heart started to beat out of my chest I knew this is what I've worked for an entire year, a chance to go to nationals and it was coming down to overtime versus the number one team in New York State". Stories like this are very key in my success when it comes to interesting readers.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing i want to develop as a writing skill is more effective word choice. Word choice can really set the tone for a paper and good words can help prove a point in writing or demonstrate an idea more effectively than ordinary words would. If i can master this skill, i feel that as a writer i can demonstrate a greater command of the english language and appear more sophisticated and intelligent. On a future job resume or a writing piece, effective word choices can help the message stick more with the reader.

My essays used to be not as strong when referring to persuasion on the subject , but it's one of the main points I try to get across in my essays now. I tend to put the subject or argument of the essay in the beginning lines so the reader is not trying to figure out what the main point is. When stating the the subject of the essay in the intro it allows the reader to understand your input and formulate theirs as either with or against yours. I always go through my rough draft to see if I got my point across or if I was just going on and on about other stuff. To keep my subject constant I continue to refer back to it after mentioning something different so my essay doesn't turn out to be a jumble of topics and become confusing. When I was in my second year of highschool I had to write an argumentative essay on policies of "playtime" for kids in elementary school for my final essay. After finishing my essay, I really thought that I got my opinion across and that the essay was simple and easy to read. Upon getting my grade of less than I expected I had to speak to my teacher about what was wrong. She helped me to ensure I stop rambling on about other things and showed me I should reread my paragraphs to make sure. My teacher expressing this to me has really strengthened my writing as now it shows more of a point and allows the reader to understand what the essay is about. Upon first learning this I was never really sure how to change it nor was I aware of this happening in my writing. Usually each paragraph after I write I tend to reread what was just written to make sure I stayed on track. I've also learned that just because I state my claim at the beginning and the end doesn't mean it was clear throughout. I understand the importance of this more and more with feedback from each teacher.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future I would love to have my essays become stronger in which they truly show what they contain and what they will be about. To find out what can do this would be very intriguing to me. To find out there such be more quotes to describe the subject or even less quotes and more inside info or references to clips or peoples research.

Yes, having proper grammar, vocabulary, and language is important and all, but it can become pointless if you don't really have anything to say or share. I want to have something to say that is actually important and can actually affect the audience and get them thinking. For example, it can be about racial stereotypes being involved in how school administrations choose what applicants to accept and how that needs to change. Depending on the topic, I also want to have some positive influence and possibly start some action. In today's society, it is time to start facing our problems instead of running or hiding them. That is the kind of writing I would like to possibly do. But I still feel like I'm learning about life. I wouldn't want to write something that is incomplete or incorrect. There is still a major learning curve that needs to be conquered and I don't feel like I have accomplished anything so far in critical thinking. Right now, still feels like the beginning or possibly nothing. I still feel like I am struggling to learn different perspectives. There is a certain barrier that I am trying to break down and it is frustrating since I personally believe I have an interesting perspective, but it may not be towards the professor. Since critical thinking is so personal, it is very difficult to train myself to think the way the professor wants me to.

Linking together strong supporting evidence is a strength of mine because it is very directed. While looking through sources, or references for an essay, it is easy to know exactly what you are looking for because the claim directs you to your evidence. This skill of mine was well developed because my high school AP Language and Composition teacher placed a large emphasis on argumentative essays, and taught the class how to effectively include sources in a paper. I know that his instruction drastically improved my writing because my sophomore year of high school, before I was under the teachers instruction, I struggled to effectively support my theses in English class. However, following AP Language and Composition, I responded to an essay prompt for a scholarship, and wrote a very effective argumentative essay about an idea to improve community of the town I live in. My papers thesis was: "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Installing waste stations throughout the Creation Walk Nature Trail would be an effective means of improving both the environment and community in Marilla." I was taught that my thesis should give the lay out of my paper, so I first described the several effects that waste receptacles on the trail would have on the environment. I then added the evidence for their effects on the community. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[I know that my argument was effective, and therefore well supported, because I won the essay contest for the Marilla Kiwanis Scholarship. Supporting a thesis is an important part of a paper, and an important skill to develop as a writer, because it helps get the point of the paper across to the reader. Additionally, it helps to prove the authenticity of your argument to your reader, and can help to prove to the reader that you, the author, knows what your talking about. Overall, the strength of the evidence supporting an argument, determines the strength of an argument.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [On the other hand, a weakness of mine in writing is writing a concise thesis.

If the order of the points in a writing are not in the correct place, the idea may seem confusing and it won't flow or make sense. All points have a certain place that makes sense for them to be in and if they are not in a logical order, the whole essay can seem confusing and not well thought out. Throughout high school my English teachers constantly stressed the importance of organizing my essays and how structure was one of the main points to constructing a successful essay. I do this well with my introduction paragraphs by clearly introducing my points and then following the same order they were introduced in with the body paragraphs. An example of this would be "Du Bois varies from Washington by sticking strongly to the suffrage movement and heavy emphasis on higher level education. They both express strong opinions on political power, civil rights, and the specific education of African Americans." That is the last sentence of my introduction of my informative essay. I set up my main three topics and then wrote my following body paragraphs in the same order I introduced them in the introduction. This ensures that the essay is going to flow, and the organization makes it easy to follow. An example of this would be the first sentence to my final body paragraph, "The final point that both Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois express feelings about is the actual education of African Americans". It clearly introduces the topic that will be discussed in the paragraph and also shows whose ideas will be examined. Going forward, I think I need to work on using more descriptive language and varying my vocabulary more. I tend to use very similar transitions and repeat the same word multiple times in my essays, which can cause the reader to lose interest. I feel that using more descriptive language would make my writing not only flow better but may make the writing appear with more depth. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lauren Kluck ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my writing, one thing that I like to focus on is punctuation. In my opinion, punctuation can make or break your writing. It helps your writing to flow and make sense. The tone and the mood of the paper can easily be determined by the punctuation. It easily allows you to put emotion into the paper. The reader is able to feel and connect with you more on whatever it is that you wrote about. Almost all of my teachers in high school would tell us how important punctuation is and how it sets the mood for the way that your paper is interpreted. Without using a comma in one spot, the reader can easily misinterpret what you were trying to say. For example, if I was to write "Hi, I am on the track team. I throw shot put and discus and weight throw and hammer throw. " no one would take me seriously, they would think that a child wrote it. It is also very choppy. If I use punctuation I can easily add in my voice and make it seem like a real person wrote it and not a robot. "Hi! I am on the track team and I compete in shot put, discus, weight throw, and hammer throw." Using punctuation I am able to list the events that I compete in as well as having more of an energetic start using the exclamation point after "Hi."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing that I would like to gain out of this course is how to write a good thesis statement and then be able to tie my writing to the thesis throughout the entire paper. I know what a good thesis is supposed to sound like but I often struggle with putting mine into words. Once I do have a thesis that I think works, I sometimes struggle with connecting everything I want to say in my essay back to the thesis. This is one of the most important concepts in writing an essay or paper and I would really like to master the technique. Mastering or even just getting down the technique of being able to write a good thesis statement that connects to everything I want to say in the essay would bring my writing to another level which is what I ultimately want.

Obtaining a solid thesis is crucial to the success and effectiveness of expressing the purpose of an essay. This does not just mean one thought, but rather includes selecting a few subordinate ideas that support and reinforce my central idea. I try to make sure I follow certain "checkpoints" I have acquired in school over the years. First of all, I ensure I have a purpose or central idea that is sufficiently limited for meaningful discussion. Secondly, I make certain my thesis idea is clearly stated, ideally as soon as possible towards the end of my introduction. Finally, it is necessary that all subordinate, or supporting, ideas relate clearly to my central idea. For example, a bad thesis would be \"There are many reasons why eating healthy is good\". Rather, I prefer to elaborate my points of my paper by stating, \"Though many reasons why eating healthy is ideal, the most important aspects are it enables a healthy heart and less risk of diabetes\". The thesis statement is just the tip of the iceberg and requires a lot of depth underneath to truly support it. There are always more skills to learn and master, constantly improving my writing and the effectiveness of my essays. Not only does this improve my grades, but my ability to pursue my goals in the real word. One thing I can work on in an academic sense, is the difference between the various formats and styles of essays such as APA, MLA, etc. This is key in not only pleasing a professor and receiving a satisfactory grade but acquiring as much useful knowledge while in school to further use down the road. Whether it be citing sources in text or in the bibliography, each format requires a different style that needs to be known to succeed. In reality, this is knowledge that can be studied and will only improve with practice. The more I write, the better I will be.

One skill I'm working on is sentence e structure because it can make or break a writing piece. My teachers have made me aware of the skill/ my lack of it when I go to them for revision or they will put small notes on the work they return stating my sentences can be too long. For example, in INTD 105 my first writing piece was a five-hundred-word introduction, after I got it back there were small edits for long sentences and not writing out my word fully, I would use its and not it is. I believe it is good to learn skills because it will make my writing smoother to the reader and understandable, as to how I can improve I want to focus on my grammar and syntax. To do that I need to write more frequently not just when it is needed and after I write I should and need to reread my writing more slowly not just skim it over one time.

I provide examples and a brief taste of the evidence that I use to prove whatever point I am trying to make. Also, I have realized that the best way to open an essay is with an interesting statement. For example, on my history essays my opening line was generally "All throughout history..." these were normally written for exams, as a result my editing had to be cut short, basically to none. My editing was minimal to save on time and most of the editing I did was while I was in my writing process. I would write something and if I didn't like the way it sounded, I would go back and change it, there would never really be more than one draft in this case. That is how I'm writing this assignment. On the other hand, when I had to write my college essay there was three drafts, and the first one had to be completely tossed out. So, I had to completely restart my essay, after that, the only changes that needed to be made were grammar mistakes. There were times that I could be a little redundant, I would reword certain sentences just to fill space. There was really no reason for including some statements other than to meet length requirements. I may also be out of practice: I haven't had a true writing assignment since my senior year of high school. There's not much more to it than that, maybe I get to the point to fast and that's why I always think my essays are too short. I would love to learn more and improve on my writing, because I feel that communication with others is the most important skill someone can have. I could be the world's smartest man, but if I didn't share my knowledge; no one would know it, and no one would be bettered by it. So long as we communicate writing is one of, if not, the most important skill a human being can learn. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Reanna Hughes =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As a writer, I have always struggled with my conclusion. I have a hard time incorporating everything that I wrote in my essay, into my conclusion. An old teacher gave me a piece of paper with a pyramid on it. The pyramid described how I should write my conclusion. The top of the pyramid represented the first couple sentences. They need to be specific and relate directly to your paper. As you move down the pyramid, your sentences become more general. The end of your conclusion is a broader statement that can relate to everything and not just what your paper was about. Even though I have this outline, I still cannot write a well-structured conclusion. My problem is I feel that no matter what I write, my conclusion is very repetitive. As a reader, a conclusion that is not strong does not leave me with a good impression of what I just read. Conclusions are Important because they are the last words that someone will read. Your conclusion needs to leave them thinking, not disappointed. I. believe all aspects of your paper are important. You need to pull your reader in and make them want to continue to read. I also have an issue of not making my conclusion simply, I "try to bring in new points or end with a whiz bang(!) conclusion or try to solve world hunger in the final sentence of your conclusion. Simplicity is best for a clear, convincing message" (Purdue Owl). Overall, a conclusion brings your whole writing together, without a strong conclusion, your paper could be slacking key points. An example of a conclusion I wrote is, "During the novel, both Rudy and Liesel create an understanding about the difference's society. They learn who is above each other and developed a sense of social class that most children cannot comprehend. The war made Rudy and Liesel mature faster and understand the harsh reality of the Holocaust earlier than most children do. The once naive, innocent children become burdened with the knowledge of what surrounds them. They learn how to survive during hard times, and how to grow from the knowledge they gained ultimately, strength is what got people through the horrible circumstances." I tried my best in this conclusion to start off specific and work my way towards being more general. I believe this is one of my better conclusions and keeps the readers engaged the whole time. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Huiming Huang =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus the most on my overall essay structure for my writing skill because using the basic structure helps the reader understand the flow and logic of the thought that I want to show. Before starting, I will make an outline for my writing so that I know what I'm doing overall. This is so important to me because I have the whole idea of the essay and I can clearly tell what is wrong with the idea. For example, I wrote my argument for my INTD 105 class a few days ago. I made the outline for my introduction into the thesis statement so that I can make clear of what I am doing for this argument. For the outline of the essay, I wrote out the introduction first and make clear what I will be writing about: "He has eleven short claims that explain the reason why one should choose the nonlover rather than the lover. Those eleven arguments have a lot of weakness that can be attacked, and I chose six of them that I feel deserve the most to attack back." After that, I listed the six points for my body paragraph: "The decent love is when they attracted to each other the way they are; The decent love shouldn't let people in the relationship troubled by the neglect of their own concerns that the relationship has caused; decent love is the people in the relationship loving each other while they are loving the world; decent love is to be yourself at the same time that the beloved can accept the you; decent love is improving and loving at the same time." In the end, I wrote the restatement of my thesis. When I officially started my essay, everything went so smooth until the end. As previous experience shows, an outline really helped my writing. \ In the future, I would like to improve my introduction. For the introduction, most of the statement is not straight forward. The reason that my statement is not straight forward is that I cannot explain my opinion as well. Through learning INTD 105 and 106, I really want to improve my skill of writing and my explanation. So that in the future, I can really express my opinion with more professional skill. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sophia Houston ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I like to focus on my introduction and conclusions. I try my best to make sure the points I'm going to cover in my paper are in the introduction, and I make it clear that I'm going to be talking about that. I always try to make sure I pull people in with the very first sentence as well, so people want to keep reading more and more. I always try to work on that for myself because I feel like if you don't have a strong introduction or conclusion, that the point of your paper doesn't get across as well for the readers. When I was younger, I would get many comments from teachers that my intros and conclusions needed work and I just couldn't seem to grasp how to properly do them, but one day it just clicked. Now, when I revise my work, I always check those two parts of my writing to make sure they're up to par with everything else and help to get my point across. An example of a \"strong\" introduction that I have done in the past is, \"A communication climate is defined as the feeling or "social tone of a relationship". By having a positive social tone, your emotional intelligence increases. My educational, friendship, and professional climates all nurture my emotional intelligence by providing positivity in my life. These factors lead me to have high life satisfaction, effective workplace interactions, high self-esteem, and an all-around happier life. There are many steps you can take to increase and improve your emotional intelligence within these various relationships of life. Other peoples' emotional intelligence is just as important as yours, so it is crucial to respect others and maybe even help improve their intelligence while also improving yours in the process\". This is an introduction that I used for my interpersonal communication class last semester. I unfortunately do not have the feedback from my professor anymore but I remember this particular one having the most positive comments out of the four essays we wrote throughout the semester. I personally like to develop skills in writing because it makes me feel more accomplished when I finish a writing assignment and I know I did everything I could to make that writing the best I can make it. And I know when people provide criticism to my writing that they're just trying to make it better and help me in the long run. One aspect of my writing that I feel I could improve is to explain my quotes better/go more into detail about information I'm talking about. This is something my teachers have always told me, and I always try to improve it as much as I can. Ways I can improve this would to be to think of the context of what I'm saying and then explain it in my own words, in relation to the quote. This is an important skill that I will continue to work hard at getting right so it can help me with effective writing skills in the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Benjamin Houseman =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on creating the body of my essay and using the technique 'Point, Evidence, Explanation' (PEE) to form my arguments before connecting a strong these and a coherent introduction. If I don't streamline my writing into this formula, then I often find myself scatter brained and unable to connect an introduction and powerful thesis to my arguments. My high school English teacher strongly advised this writing method in order to improve upon my previously lackluster introductory paragraphs. I've found that I am revising my introductions far less now that I have begun to utilize these skills. After looking at the edit history of the last two major essays I've written using these methods, there were little to no revisions of my introduction connecting to the body I had written beforehand. Going back further I see a lot of revisions and many times I end up re-writing the entire introduction because it lacks clarity and doesn't highlight my arguments well enough. Going forward, I would like to expand upon my ability to write powerful arguments, especially in utilizing source material. I feel as though my arguments can tend to be general and fail to really focus in on a key point. I think a lot of this stems from my weak vocabulary and poor word choice throughout my writing. If I get stuck on thinking of a word for what I want to say, then I often lose my train of thought and create a sentence of three separate ideas. If I can polish these areas of my writing then I will be much more confident in writing at a higher level. Below is an example of an introduction that I completely reworked. Initially, this introduction merely stated the difference between structural cinema and narrative film in one sentence and then continued into the main body of the essay (\"George Landow, during the creation of *Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, Sprocket Hole, Dirt Particles, Etc\...\"). *Clearly having an introductory paragraph, as such, which better explains the notion and intent of the paper allows for a deeper understanding of the concept put forth. The example also showcases how I have paused to search for better wording, rather than losing my train of thought and creating run-on sentences full of different and separate ideas. \"Structural cinema, or "pure film" is considered the ultimate in a cinema of extreme opposition to the mainstream narrative film due to its nature of being motivated differently and the use of certain characteristics, noticeably a fixed camera position, flicker effect, loop printing and rephotography off the screen. Narrative films are innately driven by a desire to express a story or a concept through the means of realistic time passing, character development and emotional understanding and connection between player and viewer. Structural cinema differs as the motivation stems from the filmmaker themselves and the intent to create an artistic work that reflects the process in which the film was created. The creation and conception of the work is paramount and takes precedent over actual execution of product. The films often cover more abstract concepts and, instead of forming a detailed narrative in which there is a clear plot structure and conventional, traditional sequences and expectations are followed creating works that are, arguably, simpler, conservative and predictable. Structural film, in the very essence of such, is experimental. The formats and the structure of these films is not traditional. Often, they follow a need and a desire to define cinema in a new and less calculated manner. Although some filmmakers chose to manipulate film in a precise and almost mathematical way, some choose to identify creative manners in which to alter and adapt the conception of film. George Landow, for example, during the creation of *Film in Which There Appear Edge Lettering, Sprocket Hole, Dirt Particles, Etc.*, utilized different physical properties of the actual celluloid film.\" ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Krista Hoctor =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Krista Hoctor]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/28/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I try my hardest on focus on putting all ideas together in the body paragraphs. Each paragraph has a new topic and they all follow what I am trying to say. I try my hardest to put all the ideas in a paragraph and make sure they are all together and make sense in the way they should. Everything is always explained to the best of my ability. Everything that is needed, whether it is quotes or evidence from other research, is always in the paragraph and formatted correctly. A lot of my high school career in English class was about how to express our ideas and correctly take evidence from other passages or articles that we need. One example of a paragraph I wrote is, "A non-lover will be a firm friend but the lover will not is the tenth argument Lysias uses in why to pick a non-lover over a lover. He says this because the love for the non-lover comes from association and not passion. Just because it is not coming from passion does not mean that they are the only firm friend that someone needs. A lover can be a firm friend just like the non-lover. A lover is often the person\'s best friend. He says if the lover is a firm friend, then why does a person have other friends. This can also relate to a non-lover. If the non-lover is a firm friend, then why would the person have more friends than the non-lover. This is hypocritical on the part of Lysias. He is saying it is okay for someone to have other friends when you are with a lover but not when you are with a non-lover, because a non-lover is all the friends that is needed. A person will want all types of friends and all types of people in their life and not just someone who is a non-lover." In this paragraph I have expressed the ideas I have wanted. Also I have explained my reason thoroughly in the way that was needed to get my idea across to the intended audience. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The thing I want to improve on is putting the ideas of an essay together correctly in an introduction and a conclusion. Also being able to create a solid thesis statement. I always just list what I am going to talk about in the introduction and slightly change the sentences to form the conclusion. My thesis is never really eye catching and makes you want to continue reading. I was never really taught how to write a conclusion.

I noticed in the past that I miss used there, their, and there which is also easier to be caught when reading out loud. For example, last semester I had two important reflection papers in Woman's Asian History and I noticed that when I type out my essay, I do not focus on the way I am typing. So correctly the statement should say "The fight for equality within elite East Asia has been endured for many years, and despite major advances, modern day women still face systematic oppression that their ancestors did." however, before revision it stated " The fight within elite east asia has been endured for many years and despite major advances, modern day women still faced sexist oppression." Though the sentences do not seem too different, I had mistakes such as missing capitalization and incorrect grammar. I do believe I am skilled in pulling the audience\'s attention to my writing by keeping it interesting, to be able to relate and to keep a certain rhythm. For example in the same response paper, for the conclusion I stated: "Although we have not fully reached equality, history shows improvement and evidence of growth in gender equality in Eastern Asia." I used a current issue in the United States, sexism to relate to previous Asian history. When it comes to revision, I believe that repetitiveness is key. To keep going back to the writing and compare it to the previous writing. Having a third person read the material is also very helpful. Since I am a pre-business major, I had very little writing assignments last semester. I have lost track of certain ways to gain skills in writing and personal writing was never my strong suit. I would like to regain and refresh my knowledge and also become a better writer. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Hart ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Grace Hart]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In order for a good writing piece you must have clear and conclusive points being made. This is something my writing demonstrates. Having a clear point makes writing easier to follow and more enjoyable to read. I always focus on this aspect in order to convey my message. To do this, I am direct and to the point. This gives the reader an understanding that is needed. For example, going into a story you need the basis of details in order to be able to understand the writing piece. Another way this is seen is through emails. You are giving a subject line to give the receiver a general idea of what the email contains. As a student, I receive tons of emails and having a subject line that gives just enough detail is extremely helpful. For example, I received an email with the subject line, "Summer Job Opportunity: Apply to be a Summer Assistant." This gave me just enough information to tell what the email was going to be about. It didn't give me all the specifics because they were not needed in the subject line, and instead in the actual email itself. This information gives a written email and any other form of writing meaning.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [However, there are parts of writing I would like to improve on. For example, sometimes my writing does not make logical sense when reading through it. I can make a good sequence of events present in writing, but explaining and expanding is my downfall. I believe I rely too much on the initial statement rather than expanding on an idea. Therefore, nothing is backed up by information causing the writing not to make complete sense.

Personally, when I'm reading documents, especially articles and journals for research, I appreciate it when authors stay on track and present information without going off on tangents. I believe this skill is important, especially during an essay, because as a writer I don't want to make a point and then spend a third of my essay expanding upon it and then just throwing in the rest of my points to finish the essay. I think that going in depth about a statement and just briefly talking about other statements is what makes an essay or paper weak. I realized this last semester when I wrote my first college research paper on the hypersexualization of female characters in comic books during the '80s & '90s. The one good piece of evidence I found was the common use of the "brokeback" pose which is used to describe how female superheroes are often drawn in unnatural and physically impossible poses. I had a lot to say about this piece of evidence and ended up ignoring my other arguments. When it became time to revise my paper I noticed how it made my paper sound like "Here's this great claim and evidence and argument to back it up. Now here's some other stuff that supports my thesis, I just added this to take up space.". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [During this semester I hope to learn the skills it takes to be able to generate a good thesis that carries throughout my essay. Normally I find halfway through my essay that my thesis has little to do with my actual essay and then have to either create a new thesis or scrap the majority of my work. Another problem I have with formulating a thesis is that I think of a thesis in my head and I only end up doing research that supports my preconceived thesis. This usually leaves me with weak and forced pieces of evidence that don't produce great work as a whole.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tyler Grasso ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Tyler Grasso]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD-105]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When writing, I make an effort to focus on developing my topic to its fullest potential. It's as if I was just barely going beneath the surface of whatever I was writing about. I'd almost always be on the right track in my understanding of the assignment or prompt, but there was also almost always something that I'd be missing. What helped me with this problem was the suggestion that I begin making detailed outlines and multiple drafts before writing my papers. Yes, I had learned before that outlines are where you should always start, but I never put too much stock in that. At best, I would write the prompt down and a couple bullet-points that I would touch on. I would only write one paper: the final one. But after talking with some of my teachers, I found that making an in-depth outline and multiple drafts of my papers would do me a number of favors, such as reducing the amount of time I would spend stuck with writer's block, or streamlining the overall process of writing. I used this throughout the latter half of high school, and I've continued to use it during my time at college. It has definitely saved me from some headaches. My Common Application essay, for example, ended up going through three iterations before it was ready to go into my college application. My subject that I chose to write about was how my parents' divorce was part of my coming of age story. It took a while to nail down the topic, but after making probably a dozen outlines, I found that this was an area in which I thought I could write the most powerful essay. The first draft was just a basic idea of what I wanted, and it was full of clichés and barely scratched the surface of what I was trying to say. The second draft had me add examples of how I grew; I added more world-building elements, such as a description of my family life before the divorce, and how I missed the foreshadowing because of my youth and ignorance. The third and final draft was where I cut out the clichés and made it an acceptable college application essay. With the help of my teachers I had realized that no admissions officer would want to read about how the grass really was greener on the other side, so I really had to take a moment to reflect again on the divorce and nail down some other ways that I had changed in the eight or so years since then. My final sentence had been "I regret everything that happened between my parents, but I wouldn't be who I am today without experiencing what I did." Obviously that's a no-go. That sentence was changed to "I'll never be happy with any of what happened. It makes me frown to even think of it. But I learned some important lessons along the way, and for that I feel as though I should be appreciative." All of this drafting and outlining allowed me to come out on top with a really solid essay for my application, as it has again and again since then. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Here at Geneseo, I know that I need to continue to cut down on my wordiness. Almost all of the writing assignments here at Geneseo have either word counts or page counts, so being wordy has been one "strategy" that I've used in order to reach whatever requirement I need to. Sure, it gets the job done, but at what cost? My papers must be suffering in some way/shape/form from my occasional use of longer sentences and more "flowery" language. I think that if my writing were more clear and concise, it might be more bearable for my both myself and my audience.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Taylor Grabow =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Taylor Grabow ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self- Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities REVISED ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In academic writing, I've alway done well at addressing my point in the introduction paragraph and arguing that point thoroughly throughout my essay or paper. In some of my classes throughout the years, I would receive high grades on argumentative essays. I knew that the point of these essays were to state your point which commonly is known as the thesis statement, and argue it throughout the essay or paper. For example in a paper I had written I stated "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[This problem that America is facing with the national eating disorder mainly has to do with the idea of industrial logic. This idea is explored and critiqued by Pollan throughout the book. This essay will argue what the main virtues that the local alternative has for Americans, what advantages it has over the organic alternative and what industrial logic had done to cause this." In the following paragraphs I provided evidence as to support my thesis. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[I think this is an important skill, because if you are writing something that is intended to sway a reader one way or the other, it is important to create a strong argument. Without stating your thesis or argument the reader can become lost on the purpose of the essay. This is a writing skill is one that I have focused on with my writings throughout the years and will continue to use in my years to come in my education. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Where my skills lack in my academic writing is in planning. Most of my writing in high school was completed on exams, finals and regents. When writing for any type of exam, you are under the pressure of time. This was something that always caused stress to me and therefore I didn\'t make time for planning. Planning for an essay or writing is important and can make the essay better because it would be planned out better which would cause for it to be more well written. This is something I've always lacked in, but I plan on setting aside time to thoroughly plan my essays and writings before I actually write them. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sara Gow ====================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing a piece, I tend to focus on choosing specific points from scholarly sources that I can then enhance on. This is very crucial because if I choose points that are too simple, it is hard to use my own voice in my writing to elaborate and incorporate my own opinions. My high school English teachers have always stressed to me the significance of taking educated points from scholarly sources that you can then use your own experiences and ideas to grow upon. I remember last year my teacher had our class create outlines where we would choose three significant ideas from articles for each paragraph, and between each we would have to continue the idea with our own thoughts. This helped me to realize that I need to present a majority of my own thoughts instead of just quoting someone else's works without any explanation as this draws away from your original thesis and how all your points connect. For example, in my last sociology paper, I used a quote from a Washington Post article about victims of the Parkland shooting. The quote stated, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}["]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[They're young enough to be victimized by a school shooting, but old enough to shape the aftermath." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Instead of just leaving it at that quote, I went on to stress the importance of their statement and how it related to my thesis. I discussed how this statement shows how victims of a horrific tragedy have become the voice of change at such a young age. Also, I mentioned how the students have gone on to use a devastating event to create meaning in their life and do something powerful in our world. This made my essay better as I could relate my thoughts to my original thesis and elaborate on one specific quote. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my future writing, I would like to focus more on the fluency of my writing and making sure my sentences flow between ideas. I think I typically try to incorporate as many points and ideas as I can while writing for school that I sometimes forget that my sentences must flow in order for my writing to sound like a quality piece. I need to take a point that I find from my sources and focus on elaborating, but then make it flow into a different point in a way that doesn't confuse the reader.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jacob Goldberg ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} While writing and revising essays, I constantly focus upon my own personality and narrative shining through all works. Whether it be informative, persuasive, or merely a fiction story, I always allow an eye for the audience into my own personal opinions, thoughts, and ways of speech that I participate in. I do this for characters in stories that I have had to write in an academic setting as well. Whether they differ from my own personal opinions or not, I grant the audience a view into their mind through certain speech slangs and a growth of opinion as the story evolves. I am easily able to focus upon grammar and spelling in most of my essays. As exampled can be found in my college essay where I was able to enforce my main ideas and opinions upon the subsequent situation I was writing about, \"[To spread tolerance and acceptance in the world, education is the single, most important tool. And that is what I want to devote my life to: helping others realize their worth and learn to accept themselves and the ones around them. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[I will stand for those who cannot. I will speak for those unable. I will teach the oppressed how to get back up on their feet when life knocks them down to their knees.\" ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}Without saying outright my qualities, the readers were able to gather the values that were bestowed upon me, that I use in my daily life, and how I adopted and altered them to help deal with the problems that I was faced with. Of course, there are, as well, many bad aspects of my writing that I must focus upon, and will hopefully correct through the course of this class. A huge aspect that I need to concentrate upon is being objective. Even in writing this current semester, I have struggled to remain objective in certain circumstances. In Intd 105, the class was given an assignment to describe objectively an image of your personal collection. Then, portray your personal relation to it. I found much difficulty being objective and leaving out my personal voice. Even with my submitted assignment, I saw myself continually interjecting my voice into the objective part of the piece. Following a very non-biased view of the picture, I followed with a very inferenced, opinionated statement, \"[The couple seems careless, as if they only care about the one current moment and their respective other; all other cares fleeing their mind for those few seconds.\" The above quotation truly showcases my writing predicament. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}Possible ways that I can repair my dilemma, are through reading objective pieces and gathering ways one can simply relay the facts. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mary Gibb ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Mary Gibb INTD: 106 Self Reflection Due: February 10, 2019 Something I learned at Northport High School was the correct use of connecting words and or phrases. Before my ninth grade English class I didn't fully understand where to correctly put transition words and although there were transition words in my writing, they were incorrectly placed which backfired in the end. For example in one of my essay\'s from eighth grade I state, \"And South Africa yet became better after the apartheid\". This sentence does not flow and is hard to read. To improve the structure of this sentence I state, \"Therefore, South Africa has improved since the apartheid\". The reader was not able to fully understand my writing before my ninth grade teacher taught the class how important connecting words are and the importance of placement. I then started to identify the mistakes I had consistently made throughout the previous years. Word choice and placement allows the reader to fully understand the author\'s work and thought process. Although adding transition words add to the word count, they emphasize the main ideas. For example therefore, furthermore, although, and however helps an author describe their thoughts in a clean and more sophisticated way. Going Forward, I will continue to incorporate transition words in my writing to help the sentences and ideas flow. I typically struggle with structuring my essays and making sure the essay explains the entire prompt while still making the essay sound clean. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Camille Dodard ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Writing has always been comparable to a rollercoaster ride for me, with many confidence boosting highs and heart dropping lows. Even though my school introduced essays in elementary school, I would say that my true writing career began in high school. Ninth and tenth grade were the apex of my writing. Or so I thought. It wasn't until eleventh grade when I began to realize that my previous teachers were very lenient with their grading and critique. In eleventh grade I was humbled. I got my first writing assignment and thought it would be an easy A. However, my new teacher did not share the same views as my previous ones. She wanted me to take the paper that I believed was the best I ever wrote and transcend that. Once I began to attempt to do so I realized how many key aspects were missing in my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Through my last two years of high school I learned that my papers needed to grasp readers attention and leave them thinking. To enhance my writing skills I needed to work on incorporating quotes and imagery to help the reader truly comprehend my thought process. So I began to find ways to start essays with statements that initiated deep thought. I found quotes that I could use to assert my point, or use to introduce another point of view that does not necessarily align with mine. For example in high school I had to write a paper about Langston Hughes so I started my essay with a quote from the first three lines of his poem, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Dream Deferred]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. This allowed me to introduce Hughes and go on to explain how he became an inspiration by following his dreams and not giving up. This quote also included imagery that I could reference throughout my paper. I used more vivid and descriptive vocabulary to create imagery to paint a picture in the reader\'s mind.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ With this course I want to be able to not only expand upon that aspect of my writing but also enhance the writing experience for me. Planning is something I find challenging, yet I realize its importance. A well planned paper tends to be more organized and well written. I would like to challenge myself to plan more so in return I can improve on my grammar and the overall flow of my papers. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Dillingham ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As I am revising my drafts, I mainly focus on expanding my ideas. Often, I see that in my first draft I write a lot of information that is not useful. I try to support my thesis as much as possible. When I see a sentence that does not have a purpose I immediately delete it. For example, a run on sentence. I try not to distract my reader with useless information but rather grab their attention with thought provoking ideas or questions. For example, the other day in my philosophy class we were speaking about non violence. We spoke about how individuals like MLK and Ghandi believed violence can never be justified. Replying to their argument, I asked "Would you be violent to save a loved one?" Questions like these make the reader more involved. I usually begin my pieces by quickly writing down information that comes to my mind. When I go back to my draft, I make sure that it makes sense and what I was writing is not just there to fulfill the word count. I also often refer to additional resources to make sure that my evidence supporting my thesis is correct and reliable. I like to make sure my reader understands what I am saying and it is believable. I used to have trouble with making sense of my work. My old English teacher taught me that if I read it out loud to some one, I will be able to see if it makes sense or not. That is why when i am writing, before i submit my assignment I ask for a friend or family member to read my work. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One skill I would like to see myself improve on while my time here at Geneseo or in the future is the organization of my work. I often go from one point to another and it does not connect well. While it still makes sense, my pieces definitely would be better if it flowed. These skills would help to improve the validity of my work.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexander Dietl ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write an essay, I always make my thesis statement the main focus right off the bat. The thesis statement, I think is the most important part of an essay, it's the thing that drives the reading to keep reading. When I was in High School my writing skill wasn't there, I would always be blank and just go to point to point, without slowing down and letting the person reading a chance to reflect on what they are reading. My senior year English teacher taught me how I could engage the reading and keep them interested throughout the reading. My College essay is a prime example of her teaching,\"How is Lacrosse like speaking class? this isnt a failed metaphor I promise(pg1,para1)\". hooking the reader making them want to read more to find out. She walked me through step by step helping me create this essay that would change my life forever. Personally, I believe that this essay has gotten me into SUNY Geneseo. Ever since that one English class, the one thing I took from the class and still use today as I write essays is the time she and I worked on my essay together and having her share her knowledge to me on how to create an interesting and catching essay. I will not lie, my writing skills can still and will always need improvement. My spelling and grammar are one of the main things I still struggle with to this day. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Aligi Ciancio =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One of the main things I give emphasis to when writing a paper is that the paragraph structure is correct and the introduction serve its respective purpose. This is one of the most important aspects of a successful paper since it is the best way of conveying the writers point and build a valid argument based on logical statements. The introduction must summarize the author\'s thoughts and state the thesis that will be evaluated further on in the paper. This is important because without such a statement the reader will not grasp the overall meaning of the text and most likely be confused. One of the main mistakes made is the non-thesis, which does not highlight the writers point of view and vaguely sets the tone for the paper, "In this article the author expresses his views on gun control". Since a thesis should represent the writer's opinion and try to be quite specific this alteration would be considered better, "Although there are considerable advantages in owning a firearm, the risks outweigh them and make the world a more dangerous place". Most of my writing education comes from middle and high school and I believe there is still room for improvement. One of the main flaws that I notice on my own is a tendency to write run on sentences, and I am eager to correct this since it is detrimental to the reader\'s overall comprehension of the text. Hopefully throughout this course I will learn to work around this bad habit and focus on writing clear and coherent papers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Arline Camilo Hernandez ===================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [\"Knowledge is power and through education, we can be "released from our bonds and cured of our ignorance" if not we constantly stay chained to the cave.\"]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [that\'s an example of a paper I wrote where I could\'ve introduced the quote and where I got it from instead of automatically assuming that the person reading the paper knew where I got the quote from.

This is because when you use good language it is much easier to get somebody's attention and hold it. If you use very poor language, then people will look at your writing as illegitimate and will disregard what you say very quickly. When I read a very good story, I will notice very often that the authors of the most enjoyable books will use language that is dynamic in order to keep my attention along with developing what they are saying. However not everything that I do I am proficient in. for example when I am writing it is very easy for me to get distracted in my writing so that I eventually will get off topic without realizing it. I also have a problem with how I use commas I don't understand how they work so I usually end up never using a comma which is rarely what you should do. Some possible ways that I could get better at these things is that I could have someone read my paper before I turn it in in order to see if I became distracted mid-sentence. I will also be able to utilize the writing learning center to help with grammar things such as commas. An example of this is when I wrote "people often say that there is no such as thing as the lunar landing but this in and of itself is not true." When I went through and edited it, it looked like this "some critics of the lunar landing say that there is no way the technology was able to bring people to the moon, this is not true as can be seen by the following evidence...". ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexandra Babcock =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When you read an essay that I have written the first things that'll come to mind is I can format my words in an adequate fashion, things flow where they should and you'll never see a run on. I like everything to be in order and keep things concise. One thing that I will always use to help me out is word correction, because I know all the words that I want to say but sometimes I don't put them in a sentence correctly. My high school teacher taught me that even if I don't know a word I can always use a smaller word, it's better to know what you're saying and have a good structured essay than throw in a bunch of big words that I don't know. Which makes myself look bad when I can't say the big words in class. I will always carry this piece of information with me. I have noticed I need this advice more in college than anywhere else. I am in a room with older kids, who know more or have more knowledge of something I don't. Therefore I feel challenged to say bigger words to "outdo" them. When in reality I will just look bad when I can't define or say the words I have written. My classmates would write poems and Long essays that sounded straight out of a high class novel, but I learned that when I tried to write essays like them it became nonsense, nobody understood what I was saying. Specifically when I wrote a piece regarding my step father, I used words like \"anomalistic\" which I don\'t know what it meant but it sounded smart. When I would go to read this out loud I was stuck. I couldn\'t read the words off the paper therefore just making me feel more unintelligent than I had before. One aspect I need to work on is creating imagery within my topic. When I would write pieces in my creative writing class last semester my professor hounded me continuously on my inability to make my words really come off the paper. Even though I knew what I wanted to say and it was formatted correctly it wasn't fulfilling people\'s fantasies on how good my work could become. I want to become better at this as I do have a lot to write about and I do like writing, but I need to be able to make the words come off the paper and make you the reader want to read more. We had to write mainly about ourselves and our life stories, but I had a hard time really connecting to the reader, I would tell my stories but not give any narrative My professor said my writing was dull because it wasn\'t an easy read as the papers we wrote were intended to be. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hiina Asami ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Writing a perfect academic paper, in terms of structure or grammar, is not easy. Students should learn how to write an academic paper. My writing is far beyond perfect, but I focus especially on one thing when I write; I try to make the sentences short and simple. I believe that writing the simple sentences is important, because I can avoid to create grammatical mistakes such as run-on sentences, and sentence fragments. It was Professor Belyakov who made me aware of the length of the sentences. Since I am an international student, I took writing 101 and 201, which are ESL classes, with professor Belyakov. In the class, she taught me how to write an academic paper. I used to write very long sentences before I take the ESL classes, such as \"In my country Japan, not only the number of old people but also the number of young people who support the country are decreasing, so young people have to pay higher taxes which are for pensions.\" The sentence is long enough to make me confused during the writing process, and also does not make clear sense. Then Professor Belyakov suggested me to write a paper with short sentences so that I can make fewer grammatical mistakes. Now I would rewrite the quote as following; My country Japan is facing an aging population and the decline of birth rate. As a result, young people have to pay higher taxes not to stop the pension structure flow. I learned a lot in the class, however, I still have to improve my writing skill. By learning more vocabulary, I believe that I will be able to expand the way to express myself. With wider range of vocabulary, my academic writing will be closer to perfect. I am now learning vocabulary by reading many articles and books. Reading them allows me not only to learn new words but also to improve my reading skill. I will continue working hard to be a better writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sydney Angus ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Sydney Angus Self-Reflection \#1 INTD 106 I am not a strong writer so when I revise my essays, I must pay attention because often there is a lot that needs to be corrected. The biggest thing I look for when I am first revising is spelling errors and any missing words which is important because if someone were to read my work it would need to be readable. Often when I am typing I think about what I want to write, and I can think much faster than I can type so I mistype or skip words. Most the time when I write I have someone else read it over to make sure that anything I missed when I looked over it, could be corrected. I really don't enjoy writing which makes reading over my work a little bit harder. One of my most recent examples of my writing is a paper for one of my classes. I wrote the whole thing and had all my ideas down then I went over corrected it as much as I could then I asked the person I was doing work with to look it over and she found a few mistakes, so I corrected them. This is my example before it was corrected "When I went inside I kept my head down and walk over to my set and I down and got all my stuff for class and my teacher didnt really say much to me until she told me to go to the extra help reading room." When she finished correcting it went like this "When I got inside, I kept my head down and walked over to my seat and I sat down and got all my stuff ready for class and my teacher didn't really say anything to me until she told me I had to go to the extra help reading room." One thing that I would like to learn when at Geneseo is how to use my words more persuasively when I am arguing something or trying to better prove my point.

I focus mostly on my analysis because I find that it makes the reader understand the key points I am trying to convey to them. I also find that analyzing helps me narrow down and get more precise about the message I am trying to give to my readers due to the fact that without analysis, I am just giving my readers broad and vague points without any sort of explanation to why I feel like this particular key point is important. One thing I have learned from one of my professors is that using signal phrases and analytical words can alert the reader that the point I am about to make is extremely important so therefore they need to pay close attention. This technique has helped me in my writing because when I quote something from a text, using simple words like "emphasize" or "shows" or "proves" can make a big difference by helping me give an explanation. Also, through the process of my explanation, I have learned that I can narrow my thoughts down so that I will be able to connect it to my main argument or thesis. For instance in one of my papers, I wrote "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Payne states that "strong people don't need strong leaders and people have to be made to understand that they cannot look for salvation anywhere but to themselves.."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[". Right after giving this quote, I can try to be more concrete about what the author meant by adding "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The author continues to emphasize that organizations should not be telling the African American people what to do, but they should be teaching them how to take control of their own lives. Payne is arguing that the African American people do not need to be led by a single leader for they are strong.

This irrelevancy takes a toll on my essay because I feel like it takes away the strength and importance of what I am trying to inform my readers due to the fact that it looks like I am just repeating myself over and over again.

One person who I feel is my main influence for this technique was my high school english teacher. She really pushed all of her students to use the best vocabulary possible. A simple example of this would be using different phrases in a section to avoid the instance of repetition in my word choice. An example of this could be change a word from \"another\" to something like \"additionally\". In doing this, I find myself becoming exponentially more literate the more I write. Granted, there is still much more room for my vocabulary to grow. ]{style=";"} [One thing I would like to improve on when it comes to the effectiveness of my writing is my transitions into and out of quotations.

In scientific papers, there is more explanation needed than english papers to get the reader to understand what was discovered. I have learned to list almost two dozen pieces of evidence and have reasoning for each. This gives my papers a lot to talk about, and this trend is also the same for my english or any other subject that requires a writing component. I can pick apart a topic to the bare essentials and describe it in a way that can explained to a child. Explaining terms and meanings allows the reader to better follow what is going on in the essay. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[To me, it is more important that the reader understands my argument and is able to support it with facts because then it allows the reader to counter another argument by using the evidence I have given.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ I was taught from middle school to the end of high school to state a claim and support it, we were given the flexibility to write how we wanted and the teachers would polish up the paper when grading. I tell them a fact, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The Hebrews must follow these laws because their god commanded them to, or be at risk of committing a sin", and then I'll explain any terms or phrases that would need clarification, "To sin in Hebrew culture...".

I try to tighten my diction as I go back and edit my pieces to ensure that my message comes across clearly and is not hidden beneath unnecessary words. To me, the most important part of writing is connecting to the audience. If other people have difficulty understanding what I have written, they won't take it seriously and may disregard it entirely. Also, in the communication classes I took during my first semester here, especially Meda Writing, I learned how much more enjoyable it is to read when the information you're taking in is not needlessly wordy. An example of a time I've realized this while editing is when I wrote an editorial piece about tattoos for the media writing class. I wrote the sentence "They are putting something on their body that will provide an extension of their personality to the world around them, influencing how people they may never even speak to will perceive them." and then realized I could say the same thing in a more simple way. I then edited it to this, "They are putting an extension of their personality onto their body which will affect the way people perceive them." I try to do this every time I write no matter what style it is in because no one wants to read something unnecessarily complex. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would like to further develop my ability to grab a reader's attention and keep them interested throughout the piece. I think that sometimes I'll be too focused on trying to sound smart and be accurate that I won't actually be saying anything too intriguing. I want to learn how to use powerful diction and write in a way that will make the reader feel something and want to keep going, even if it's an academic paper. Writing in a more powerful way will help me to feel more confident in my work, lead me to receiving better grades and make my writing more enjoyable to read.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Vera Potter ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of writing I focus on intently is using correct punctuation. I take care never to omit commas or use run-on sentences. I may use inordinately long sentences from time to time, but I always make certain that the clauses fit together correctly, a skill that studying Latin for several years likely helped to hone. My eighth-grade English teacher, Mr. Kloepfer, impressed the rules of correct comma usage on our class so intently that I have never forgotten them. I will also never forget his elderly corgi, who used a sort of canine wheelchair to support his hind legs, but that is entirely beside the point. Misusing commas can lead to hilariously bizarre results- to give one classic example, removing a comma from the sentence \"Let\'s eat, Grandma!\" turns it into an exhortation toward cannibalism. Unlike other types of grammatical errors, punctuation slip-ups frequently change the meaning of a sentence. It\'s the textual equivalent of a genetic mutation that affects a crucial bodily system, as opposed to one that causes minor changes in appearance. Going forward, I want to improve two skills which are sides of the same metaphorical coin. I need to work on elaborating on my arguments in general writing, and I need to reduce the proportion of \"fluff\" in my scientific papers. However, the latter is probably more important in the long run, as I plan to pursue a career in science. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Eileen Portorreal =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I focus on is my thesis statement. As I write my essays, I always make sure to include a thesis statement, especially within the introduction of the paper that is being written. In high school, my English teacher provided me with a template that helped write an introduction in a way that would introduce the main idea of the paper and also include a thesis statement stating the main idea that will later be developed, supported and explained throughout the course of the paper, most specifically with the use of examples and evidence. Within the thesis statement, I make sure to summarize the main idea into one sentence that will be mentioned throughout the paper with supportive reasoning and place the sentence as the last one of the introduction to close it off and flow into the other paragraphs by going more into depth of the statement. For instance, one thesis statement I once wrote for a sociology paper was, "Mears took it as her job to deconstruct the glamorized idea of the modeling industry and reveals the mistreatment that takes place within the industry." This thesis statement expressed in one sentence what the main gist of my paper and allowed me to go into depth with it in the rest of my paper by supporting my claim with reasoning, examples and evidence. One aspect I want to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo would be vocabulary. I would like to improve my vocabulary for future writing assignments in order to effectively and strongly state my claim and I plan to do this by being open to using new vocabulary I learn everyday. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Olivia Pontello ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I do my best to focus on keeping the argument geared towards a specific side, without summarizing the text. When I proofread all of my writing, I notice that in a lot of areas I accidentally summarize the plot without meaning to. It's like this subconscious tendency that I have where I think that I have to give the reader the background (or the proof) of what I'm writing about to prove that what I'm saying makes sense. My high school literature teacher would always tell me to focus on making my own points and not worrying about whether the reader is familiar with what I'm writing about or not. An example of plot summary that I've used in a past essay is, "at first, she introduced Frederick to reading but then when her husband forbade it, she became a nasty person quite soon". This is directly summarized from the book. What I had done was written what had happened in the book as a segue into writing about my thoughts on that scene within the novel. A better way to write this would have been "based on Mrs. Auld's actions in the book, it is clear that slavery has detrimental effects to the psyche of slaveholders as well as the slaves themselves." This references the event of the book without explicitly laying out that plot line. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing I'm always looking to improve on is my writing, both academic and personal. I would like to be able to write confidently and concisely in the future, without having to worry about not getting my personal point and argument across.

I pride myself in the layout of the evidence I include, or the topics of the paragraphs following a specific order and format. Where I lack in other parts of an essay that others may have strengths in, I ensure the main themes are understandable and are in an understandable format. For example, I wrote an essay in AP English during my senior year of high school which was centered on the topic of Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, in which we were required to find examples of how the Monster displayed human-like characteristics. After receiving my essay back, I lost points on a poor introduction, but my teacher had written a comment on how the use of evidence and the structure I presented it in was the best in the class. This skill is important to me as it is a way of strengthening my writing and ensuring the reader is able to follow along. My ability to work the evidence or theme into the writing changes the outcome of the piece entirely. Instead of merely including "If I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear!", I led with \"The Monster\'s passion for expressing his newfound emotions invoke a severe response from him when confronted, and he exclaims \'If I cannot\...\'\", and conclude with a statement summarizing how humans would have similar responses when inspired by passion. As I had mentioned, I feel my introductions and or thesis statements lack greatly, I hope to gain insight on proper development of the subjects during this course and INTD 105, as it is the first thing the reader lays their eyes on, and I need to hook them into the piece or they will continue it with no regard for the strengths I exhibit in the rest of my writing. I feel writing drafts, and then having a peer or professor provide insight on them might lead me to a stronger, more finalized method of writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Max Pham ====================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of writing I tend to focus on, sometimes to a fault, is the use of "better words" or synonyms that make my argument sound more sophisticated and for my writing to seem more interesting. I have been both criticized and praised for my use of words in essays by the same high school English teacher. She once told me as a general rule of thumb to not have more than one 'fancy' word in a sentence, as it loses its power when used too frequently. As an example where I overuse my vocabulary, in an analysis of the poem 'For my lover, returning to his wife' I initially wrote: "The mistress has no say in making the man stay even if she wants him to since she was only a temporary interest and luxury for the man, as proven when she describes her existence in the man's life as "Littleneck clams out of season." Littleneck clams are only available in specific seasons and are considered a delicacy to many people, in this case, a delicacy for the man. Her love was only momentary and ephemeral like littleneck clams out of season, thus, will no longer be available after the said season was over." But upon revision, I was able to narrow down my point to: "The mistress' existence is comparable to Littleneck clams; temporary, but a delicacy." Moving forward, I'd like to improve on my precision in writing. I feel like I tend to obsess over a particular point and would stretch the point out until it became mundane and repetitive. I would like to be more concise in the sense that I want to be able to build a better structure that would allow me to avoid things like repetition. I also feel like this is a universal issue that a lot of writers face and there are plenty of resources out there to help me but most importantly, I think it comes from practice. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julia Pettis ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I focus on creating a compelling introductory paragraph with a thought-provoking thesis statement. My history teacher last semester taught me about using the initial paragraph as an outline for the rest of the essay. An example of a revision I made began with, "Historically, South Africa has been separated by race. Apartheid was the pinnacle of this, which legally separated South Africa by ethnicity." This was very generalized and not thought-provoking, as well as repetitive, so I revised it. My final thesis statement came to be, "Since the discovery of South Africa by European settlers in 1652, natives have been succumbed to racial mistreatment. In the twentieth century racial divides climaxed with the creation of apartheid, which separated South Africa solely based on ethnicity." By creating a beginning statement, it helps me determine a focused topic and argument for the rest of my paper. In the future, I'd like to work on my ability to increase or reduce the amount of writing in my papers in compliance with the recommended word count of my professor. I tend to either write too much and begin being repetitive, or struggle to fit the necessary word count, based on the amount of research I've compiled and my interest in the subject. I plan to work on how I research my papers in order to have enough information, and I hope to learn how to shorten an essay when my word count is too high. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jasmine Petrishin =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I believe that one strength of my writing is the proper use of APA format. I have written many papers throughout my college career and found it useful to be comfortable with APA organization and style. Research papers consistently follow APA format to ensure clarity and ease of access to outside sources. One skill that I immediately had to work on was appropriate citation structure. In high school, I was taught to utilize automatic citation generators online. I quickly learned how inaccurate and useless these tools were for college writing. For example, a proper citation for a research article would be "Sharpe, D., Walters, A., & Goren, M. (2015, July 15). Effect of cheating experience on attitudes toward infidelity. *Sexuality and Culture. 17*, 643-658.", whereas the automatic citation only came up with "Sharpe, D., Walters, A., & Goren, M. (2015). Effect of Cheating Experience on Attitudes toward Infidelity". Many times, the online generator misses important information which is not acceptable in college writing. One of my professors focused on correct APA style when reporting statistics. I had a lot of practice writing in concise language and becoming more comfortable with producing my own citations. One area that I would like to develop is making my informal writing more coherent. When I am not writing a research report or review, I struggle with the flow of my ideas. At times, my papers seem choppy and out of order. Possible solutions to this problem could be focusing on transitions between paragraphs and having a decisive, organized plan. I believe that developing this skill will make me a better writer in general and make my opinions sound more credible. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sydney Petrella ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [While writing, I put a strong highlighted focus on the body paragraphs. I think that the opening thesis statement is important; but, for me personally, I want to make sure that everything is backed up with facts and any textual evidence. This is in order to make the points mentioned in the thesis more concrete. My AP Literature and Composition teacher in high school always stressed the importance of making one's argument solid, and never shying away from incorporating extra ideas that can assist. I was taught to expand my writing to sound more fluid rather than simply stating exactly what the paragraph was introducing. The topic sentences should be the captivating piece of a paragraph. An example of an opening sentence ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[before]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ being, "Another motif of the book is beauty, it is something Diver notices in Rosemary". This itself sounds very choppy, which is why I need to make the changes so it sounds more sophisticated: "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Beauty has the ability to strike a person's attention, especially in a new form.

I have found that my conclusions are very sudden and short. I feel as though if I added more substance to them, it would create a more swift closing, so I would like to work on perfecting that while at Geneseo. After the first semester here, I have been able to learn how and when to take advantage of resources, so I feel confident that I'll be able to fix this writing concern.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(267 words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Terra Peter ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my eleventh grade AP Language and Composition class, my teacher emphasized the importance of concise writing without using the passive voice. Since then, I have paid careful attention to this as I edit my writing. Often times, I find unnecessary words in my early drafts where I am simply trying to get my ideas out, which is reasonable, but I am not always able to quickly spot the redundant words. Furthermore, a lot of times the extra words in my writing create sentences in the passive voice. This makes my writing sound less definitive and, in some cases, convincing. Last night, I drafted and email to my area coordinator about a roommate situation, and in my draft, I found many examples of passive voice which made me seem uncertain in what I was saying. For example, I first wrote "I feel as though it would be too stressful to switch rooms right now," so I then edited the "I feel as though" to "it seems too stressful to switch rooms right now," which sounds more decisive. For the future, I know it is important that I explain my ideas in the clearest yet shortest way possible. I hope to be a teacher, so in order to communicate effectively with my students and co-workers I need to be concise yet not sacrifice clarity. In particular, my writing needs to be easy to comprehend as to not confuse my students. I am then hoping that INTD 105 and 106 can both help me improve on my writing skills, in turn making me an effective and efficient communicator. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julie Perrone =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Julie Perrone ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD-106-01]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [10 February 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I revise my drafts, I consciously focus not only the relevancy and insightfulness of the quotes I use, but the way in which I integrate these quotes that will not disrupt the coherency of the essay. I find this extremely imperative in any type of essay in which I use quotes because when not integrated properly, the flow of thoughts in an essay could be compromised. In one of the essays that I wrote in my early years of high school, I did not grasp the concept of integrating quotes. For example, when I wanted to use the quote "\... as a slightly less wasteful consumer owing to what I have learned as a scavenger," from Lars Eighner's "On Dumpster Diving," I would simply state it as one sentence and begin analysing it over the next few sentences. However, when my teacher noticed this pattern he informed me on how I should use integration skills in order to maintain a more intellectual essay. Therefore, in the following revised draft I turned the chopped quote into "When introducing the concept of preservation to his audience, Eighner states, "\... as a slightly less wasteful consumer owing to what I have learned as a scavenger" (para 5). ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [At Geneseo and onward, I want to effectively develop the skill of writing concluding statements that avoid useless redundancy of information, and that go beyond simply restating the introduction. When I write conclusions, especially in the majority of my writing in high school, I always struggle with whether or not I lack strength in the skill that pushes my conclusions from just a "good" restatement to a "brilliant" collaboration of thoughts. Therefore, actively working on this said skill will propel my writing to a higher level. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Although I know it is essential, in most cases, to restate the thesis and all main points from previous body paragraphs in a conclusion, I want to push myself further as a writer in which I include and expand upon thoughts of my own in an efficient and successful manner, rather than spewing countless regurgitated points which were made earlier in the essay at hand. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Chloe Perez ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on having a strong claim and appropriate evidence throughout my writing, because that is how I make sure that my point is easily identifiable to my reader. In high school I learned through teacher's comments that if I don't back up my argument with appropriate evidence my original point would not mean much to the reader. An example of this would be if I initially start off with the claim that "Through the use of female characters in the novel, Austen conveys the negative view she carries of Regency Era society", then go on to use the evidence that despite Mr. Collins being horrible, Elizabeth's mother and even society still expect her to accept his proposal and when Elizabeth rejects his proposal it is unthinkable, demonstrating Austen\'s critique of the patriarchy of the time, my claim becomes stronger as I have the text backing up my commentary. As a writer I feel as though my writing can always be improved upon, which is why I enjoy picking up new skills to help further develop my writing. Areas that I definitely need to improve upon would be my spelling, grammar and punctuation. I often find myself unsure in what punctuation marks I should put and where. Perhaps I could seek different readings on how to properly implement a comma or dash, and when it would be appropriate to use it. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Haley Peck ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Haley Peck]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Reflective Essay 1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Throughout my writing I focus a lot on transitions between paragraphs and into quotations. I was taught only the basics in high school of placing evidence in my writing and then analyzing the quotes so I always used stand alone quotes. However, I have realized that using all types of transitions has created my writing to be more sophisticated and smooth. Without transitions pieces of writing become choppy and confusing. It is clear that transitions also help with structure and getting the reader to understand the direction you are trying to go. For example, instead of just throwing out new ideas when moving from paragraph to paragraph I use words like "Moreover," "Similarly," and "Furthermore." These words and many others can be used as templates when writing for any topic. Also, when transitioning into quotes I have started using phrases such as "Author X exclaims\..." and "In Author X's own words..." I try and focus a lot on transitions while writing because it really enhances the experience of reading the piece. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect I want to develop in my writing is style. Style is very difficult to get across in writing and a hard skill to obtain. I was taught all throughout high school to never use first person in my writing or any other stylistic approaches.

When an essay is well structured it makes reading that essay feel smooth by connecting related points together. Poor structure in writing makes it much more difficult to understand the points of the paper. I was taught about how to structure my writing by my teachers all throughout school. This was always one of their main points when they were teaching us how to write. All of my teachers encouraged my writing to flow smoothly within an idea as well as when I'm transitioning between ideas. Most of the time when talking about just one idea, I will structure the idea into a paragraph. It will flow from the introduction, to the examples and explaining the examples, and finally to the conclusion of that idea. To transition between different ideas, I try to have a conclusion for the first idea that can flow smoothly into the introduction of the next idea. For example, to end my first idea I said, "I understand how only thinking about myself in a conflict can be negative." To introduce my next idea I said, "The first strategy I would like to start using is compromising." I had to make the transition between these two ideas flow smoothly so I said, "I understand how only thinking about myself in a conflict can be negative, and I'd like to start using different conflict strategies to be more thoughtful towards others. The first strategy I would like to start using is compromising." By making my writing structured within ideas and when transitioning between ideas it makes the entire paper structured and flow nicely. One aspect of my writing I'd like to work on is the language I use. I don't have a huge vocabulary when I'm writing which can make my ideas less appealing than someone else writing about the same subject with a better vocabulary. I typically just write the words that come to mind instead of thinking of the best possible word for different scenarios. I'd like to change this and start using more intelligent words throughout my writings. I could start slowing down while writing to think more about what words I'm using and look back when I'm finished to make sure everything is saying what I want it to. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Raj Patel ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing, which I focus upon within my works, is the establishment of a strong thesis. An essay prompt may range from the simplest, or, to the most complex requiring argument; regardless, the establishment of a strong thesis instills not only the tone of the essay, but also the purpose, and subject, which the essay's theme revolves around. I am most definitely confident in my abilities to not only develop an extremely strong thesis, but also to defend my thesis through the uses of in-text proofs. This skill of developing an immaculately-structured argument is not honed by many fellow students; the ability to develop a perfect thesis was ingrained within me by my high school AP English teacher and Collegiate Church History teacher. A snippet from one of my previous essays, which demonstrates a well-structured thesis goes as follows: "Shelley illustrates Victor's suffering and the suffering of others, in order to elucidate the idea that those who strive against the boundaries of life and death are often the cause of suffering brought upon others. However, Shelley also utilizes Victor's errorful judgment and vile consequences as a reaction to the scientific revolution during her time; through illustrating Victor's grim consequences, Shelley comments on the dangers man must face in result of their scientific inquisitiveness, which originates from striving against the pre-existing limitations on humanity's existence." The aforementioned example from one of my essays, demonstrates a thesis, which begins in a broader focal point, and narrows done to the details of the author's purpose. I feel as if I am able to write any essay provided whatever prompt, due to my ability to hone and master the foundational and quintessential skill of generating a well-structured thesis. An area, which I may further need to develop upon is the ability to shorten my thesis, as many of them are extended beyond average length. In order to develop shorter thesis statements, I may utilize various techniques such as punctuations marks, rather than stating full sentences, I may utilize semicolons in order to state shortened ideas, rather than full on and expanded ideas. One aspect of writing, which I wish to develop upon during my time at Geneseo, would be to generate shorter essays. Therefore, those who are about to read my essays do not fret at its length and back away from reading the essay. This may be achieved through the use of shorter sentences, and more clear and concise thoughts. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Walter Paskoff ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Walter Paskoff In high school I used to believe it was best to treat each writing assignment as if someone were learning about the topic for the first time. As I have become a more seasoned and educated writer, I now know that it's better to make the reader think and form an opinion based on my own. For example, when writing an essay for the novel [Things Fall Apart]{.underline}, I used the first two paragraphs of my paper to simply summarize the novel. As I have learned from my sophomore year English teacher, summary is only really needed when it applies to the analysis that follows. So, as I revise my writing now, I always make it a point to check to see if the summary is truly necessary, rather than just filling space. Summary is a great tool to use when describing something for the first time. However, at my current level, it can be assumed that the target reader has already read and formed their own opinion about the work in question. Instead, I should aim to start a debate over the work with a topic or idea that may not be as universally agreed upon as summary. As I continue, I would like to work on how I form my writing. Although it seems like an obvious point of emphasis, a simple correction such as switching the order of paragraphs could take my writing to the next level. I often write whatever I am thinking of, which frequently leads to solid ideas formatted poorly. If, when revising my writing from here on out, I reread it objectively I could see what sequence makes the most sense to a reader in order to keep their interest throughout the piece. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Evan Panzer ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I find that one problem I face when doing academic writing is my tendency to use my own voice in my writing. What I mean by this is that sometimes I may get a little off topic and decide to come up with my own thoughts rather than those that can be backed up with citations from the source. I think it\'s important to be objective in academic writing so that you\'re argument has more validity, and isn\'t just a representation of ones own thoughts. Emphasis should be kept on the argument, rather than on myself or my experiences. A great example of this would be when I wrote my Capstone IRR essay. In this essay, I discussed the effect that technology can have on children, but often used by own voice and opinions instead of the facts stated in the sources. \"[Children\'s brains are very fragile at a young age, and need to grow with care. Cris Rowan, a therapist and author of, "The Impact of Technology on the Developing Child", explains that, "Four critical factors \[are\] necessary to achieve healthy child development are movement, touch, human connection, and exposure to nature"(Rowan). Without these needs being met, the future generations of children will begin to see many issues and drastic changes in how people function. The overuse of technology by developing children has cause a shift from being active, to a lazy generation that uses technology for all their entertainment and in order to ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[interact]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ with people. Even in my situation, I have began to rely on technology more instead of being an active learner. This may pose as a problem for me and others as we continue to grow.\" At the end of example, I clearly bring in a personal experience which should probably be left out, considering that it doesn\'t add to the argument and barely adds to my synthesis of this quote.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} In the future, I\'d like to concentrate on using more citations from credible sources in order to ensure that my ideas aren\'t being thrown into the essay without being backed up properly. This would help me to greatly increase the effectiveness of my writing, while also adding more synthesis of ideas. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Megan Palmer ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing I already focus on consciously as I revise my drafts is whether or not my writing immediately grabs my readers attention and maintains in throughout the piece. Clearly, this is a very important aspect of writing that has been a major focus for all students since they first learned to write. I can still remember the first time I wrote an effective introduction to make my reader interested in my essay, and even though I was in just fifth grade it is an example I can look back on even today to realize the importance of catching your readers' attention in the beginning of your paper. The example is "My palms were sweaty, and I felt my heart pound heavily in my chest as I thought about what my friends asked me to do". This is what my first sentence of my paper was for a D.A.R.E essay, after I revised it to be more attention grabbing from something like, "I nervously thought about what my friends wanted me to do". As you can see, after my revision the beginning of my paper was much more interesting to the audience, and it made them want to read more. One aspect that I want to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo and beyond is establishing credibility as a writer. There are many ways to do this, but the one I would like to focus on based on previous feedback I have received is using more evidence to make myself more credible. This skill is important because if your writing doesn't sound credible, people are likely to overlook the points you are arguing. One of my previous professors has greatly helped shape this skill, but I know that I clearly have a long way to go still in terms of learning how to establish credibility. I learned from this professor that one way I can properly establish credibility is to use outside sources, so that is something I will try to do more of. I would like to learn new skills because I want to improve my writing, especially because I can see writing as part of my life in the future. As mentioned, one way I can possibly develop this skill is to use outside information in my writing that is credible itself. Therefore, I would like to work on many new skills as a writer, but most of all establishing credibility. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brendan Owens =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [An aspect of academic writing I try to focus on in my revision of drafts is the construction of ideas in my paragraphs which blends with word choice in a sense but that doesn\'t quite encapsulate the whole of the idea. It\'s not just about word choice as much as making sure that an idea in my head or point i'm trying to make fully makes sense once I\'ve typed it out onto the page. This rephrasing of ideas and points comes from my own attempts to smooth out the ideas as they come tumbling out of my head and sometimes require a second set of eyes to accomplish. A skill like this is important because for me the first time I try writing something it never comes out right, going back and smoothing out the details allows for my writing to sound more put together and show overall improvement from when the ideas and the words first come together. Last semester i had a paper to do about chimps on my anthropology class, i did half the paper myself going back as i do to try and see if everything made sense and eventually a friend of mine asked if i needed help and for the rest of the paper we went through paragraph at a time ironing out just how what i was going to express and how to show it properly. One such idea was to show some of the behavioral similarities between chimps and humans through what the film had shown us about the chimp family the movie was about. This skill is something i need as a writer to help structure my writing as i'm doing it, and it helped me with that anthropology paper as i hope it will help me with papers in the future as well. A skill I more need to work on is in formatting my writing as i write in much the same way as i talk, very stream of consciousness, it's a kind of challenge for me to focus as much as i need to when it comes to the proper formatting of papers or emails and what have you, i do think that slowing down and formatting as i go along would help sort of not stopping the stream but just not letting it rush ahead of me.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Natalie Orman =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ Something I am proud of in my writing is that when I need to quote a text or person, I try rather hard to stray from phrases like "she says" this, or "they said" that. I find it important to use more attention grabbing verbs and language that make sure the author of the quote's voice is heard in my writing. Papers should essentially be written like a conversation and it is not fair of writers to not give the other authors they are incorporating a voice. It is important to have multiple points of view in a paper for one to then branch off onto their own ideas and arguments. So, for instance when the author you are quoting or paraphrasing is making a claim then you could say something similar to " The author]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ asserts]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ that 3rd wave feminist movements in the 90's were misrepresented". This is small change really helps my writing and keeps the reader invested.

I write very generalized, which is not a very good quality and habit to get into, especially for a history major like myself. I think my trouble is that I am afraid of redundancy in my papers but I also believe if I worked more on my writing I could find a compromise with myself and reiterate certain points from my arguments in strategic areas throughout my papers. Once I start making that move in my writing I think it could help me with transitional parts in papers as well as help analysis of quotes and points made in my claims.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Patrick O\'Sullivan ================================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [A writing skill I need to work on is improving my sentence structure to create a cohesive flow within my thoughts and ideas. This skill is very important since it helps direct my arguments to a more cohesive approach and explain my point of view. In high school, I received support from my high school English teachers and that ultimately built my confidence. They have taught me different strategies to make my sentences more understandable and clear. Throughout this course, I will keep on practicing my writing structure and use the information learned in the modules to make improvements. One example of an unclear sentence I wrote and thought was formatted correctly was, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[These are kinds of long-lasting relationships and in comparison, vulnerabilities with a mother and its child are not normally found in chimps." This sentence is poorly written since it includes two different sentence fragments that do not make sense when put together. I also used the transition, "in comparison" but there is no other idea to compare it to. After revising, I fixed my sentence and wrote: "In comparison to the vulnerabilities a mother has with its child, chimps are usually not very affectionate." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward in this course, I need to improve my sentence structure and focus on the different aspects that make a "proper" sentence.

I rely too much on my information and not actually arguing my point during my writings. I hope I am able to learn more about sentence fragments and how to correctly make "proper" sentences to improve my writing throughout this course. This will tremendously help me succeed in my INTD 105 course, and any other future courses that include writing assignments.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alex O\'Reilly ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Alex O'Reilly 2/9/19 Self-Reflection \#1 When I write an essay or a research paper, I focus most on explaining my quotes and telling the reader why I picked that quote and how it relates to my argument. When a writer just provides the reader with a quote, it's hard to understand the argument they're trying to make with said quote, especially if the quote is very abstract and the reader doesn't have enough knowledge of the subject in order to pick up the subtler details. That's why I find explanation of quotes so important and choose to focus on them, it gives readers a better understanding of why writers pick certain quotes and almost gives them a path into the psyche of the writer and helping them understand how they think and see said quote. I feel like I pick quotes that have deeper meanings to them and enjoy explaining how I picked and understood the quote. An example of this is in my final sociology paper I wrote last semester. I wrote "'face up to 'demands of the day' within an increasingly rationalized and soulless world and one which is characterized by 'disenchantment'' (Weber 154). A point he is making here is that he calls this world soulless and characterizing it as "disenchantment", this is him explaining that as rationalization and science is growing, religion is fading leading to this soulless world that people must face. He's using the word "disenchantment" as a metaphor for the world losing religion which could be the world's soul since many people believe and rely on religion for help and guidance". In the quote I picked there was the obvious explanation that Weber is arguing that as rationalization grows, religion fades into the realm of irrational. But I decided to take it one step further and explain the deeper meaning to this quote that most readers can't really understand. So, I pride myself on my ability to explain deeper meanings behind quotes in a way that's easier for the reader to understand. Going forward I would like to focus on expanding my use of vocabulary and sentence structure. I feel like the vocabulary I use and how I write my sentences is very repetitive and can seem bland or boring after a while. I could possibly learn from my classmates or professor in INTD 105. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Erin O\'Connell ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I focus on is punctuation and grammar because it provides details that assist with how the reader is comprehending your work. It also allows for clear communication and provides the reader with an accurate depiction of the point you're trying to get across. With the help of my high school English teachers, I have learned to further expand my vocabulary and use proper punctuation in my writing. For example in a recent writing assignment I had, I initially wrote "The grading rubric can not be altered and grades your written assignment by two parts; the quality of your writing and whether you have the correct information." Upon further revisement, I realized that I used a semicolon instead of a colon and could have used more precise vocabulary. I then changed the statement to "The grading rubric is not flexible and grades your written assignment with regards to two criteria: the quality of your writing and whether you have the correct information."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I would like to further develop is my ability to provide an enticing topic sentence that pulls the reader in and makes them interested in what they will be reading. Without a captivating introduction sentence, the reader will not have the desire to continue reading and will most likely become easily bored. I generally have a difficult time thinking of something that will not only encompass what I will be talking about but will also make the reader hooked and want to continue reading. I will be sure to work on creating more compelling topic sentences that spikes the reader's interests and makes them want to continue reading.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Carly Nunneker ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One thing I focus on with academic writing is trying to make the piece of writing exciting to read and relatable for the reader. There's nothing worse than trying to read a piece of writing and it being bland, unorganized and boring to read. An easy way I like to combat that issue is making it relatable. For example, on a paper, I had to write on a collection of Rudyard Kipling's short stories, instead of just simply summarizing the stories and giving my opinion on them, I added in the pros and cons of using historical fiction to teach historical facts. Anything that adds a little more to a topic without going completely off topic can help make things more interesting. This is something I was taught years ago by one of my teachers, and I really think it's helped me grow as a writer. One thing I want to work on as a writer is having that "wow factor" in my writing. I usually don't get too many negative comments on my writing, I usually tick all of the boxes in what people are looking for, so I usually do pretty well. I think I just need to be better as a writer overall and become the kind of writer that makes people think "wow, that was incredible" after they finish reading.

The presentation of evidence is the entire point of many pieces of writing. Evidence is what is able to effectively convince people to the correct side of any issue, but more importantly it has the potential to change how people think and process information. Effective conveyance of evidence can be broken down into so many different elements, but my favorite has always been the specific words chosen in a piece of text. Translating *The Aeneid *by Vergil in AP Latin during my senior year of High School has forever changed the way I\'ve viewed the use of specific words over potential replacement synonyms. Little in my years of education at this point of my life compare to the way that Vergil\'s use of language revived what I began to feel was a lackluster subject of schooling. While translating as strictly as the AP graders would allow, the seemingly unpolished English translations we arrived at gave a depth to the text that I am unable to find a suitable match to. That was the most challenging class that I\'ve ever taken, but also the one I enjoyed the most. A big portion of my writing that I wish to improve upon would be my spelling and my use of conjunctions, specifically \"but\". Spelling would just be an issue off the electronic platform of this class that I\'d need to improve upon. Conjunctions would be able to be trained through experimenting in the various papers of this course and receiving feedback upon them. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cameron Normandeau ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing, I ensure my diction is appropriate for the subject and for my audience. Diction is important in any writing, it has the power to influence readers' thoughts on a subject. Small changes in diction and the denotative or connotative meaning of each word can have large impacts on the impression an essay or other written work leaves on the reader. In preparation for AP tests, my high school English teachers demonstrated the importance of diction in writing. For example, I recently drafted an email to a professor that I adjusted my diction in to better suit the purpose of the message. "I am sorry that I did not submit the link in class. At any rate, here it is. Thank you." was the original message. I changed this to: "I am terribly sorry that the link was not submitted in class. I have included it here, however. I appreciate your understanding." The adjusted message does not incriminate my wrong doing by directly using a personal pronoun to describe my failure to submit the link. It also reads as a more sincere attempt to apologize for the late submission, which could make a professor more sympathetic to my situation. This skill can be applied to everyday writing and has already helped me immensely in academic writing as well as professional writing. Learning this skill and practicing it have paid off in all cases where I have been able to apply it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would like to develop my professional essay writing skills. Higher level writing assignments that incorporate legitimate citations and sources have proven to be a difficult task for me in the past.

This skill is important because when writing about history it is necessary that it is in past tense. Also, your paper could get very confusing if you continuously switch between different tenses. While in high school, I had to write a lot of papers in my U.S. History and English class and I was hammered by my teachers on sticking to one tense. In INTD 105, we are writing an essay on the African American experience during the twentieth century. I wrote mine mainly in past tense because the essays in which we were obtaining our info happened in the past. This excerpt from my paper is a great example of my skill to focus on tenses: "As portrayed by Zora Neale Hurston, James Baldwin, and Maya Angelou in their essays compiled in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Best American Essays of the Century]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, the African American experience in modern America, during the 20th century, was affected tremendously by color.

I tend to use facts as my thesis rather than as support. One example of this is in a paper I submitted last semester. It was my first attempt at college-level writing. My introduction consisted of, "There were many ways in which enslaved Africans took charge of their own beings." as its thesis. This sentence is merely a fact based on what I had studied about the subject matter. This does not give the reader insight into what I am going to argue or present in my essay. Rather than that, my thesis should have been more like, "The many ways in which enslaved Africans took charge of their own beings in spite of their circumstance is telling of their strength."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Another habit I still struggle with as a writer is repetition. I usually try to make sure that the reader can connect the examples presented with the thesis. Because of this, my essays tend to get quite repetitive. I seem to assert my thesis after each and every example. It's almost as if I am unsure that the reader will receive it as an example to support my thesis. This was mentioned in my professor\'s comments on this paper. This can make my essays difficult to understand and can lose the reader\'s attention. For example, in the aforementioned essay, I used many variations of the phrase, "enslaved Africans reclaimed their rights to their own bodies". This was stated essentially after every example. Rather than reasserting the thesis so aggressively, I should let the examples serve their purpose.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would overall like to improve my ability to present my own arguments and research without resorting to immature habits.

In conclusion because of my writing style this leads to a lack of planning and to a lack of extra development and further explanation and proof. This skill is important because voice is a good thing to have in an essay but it is all about when and where you instill this in your writing which leads to an extra developed and good essay. When I was in high school my english teacher helped me a lot she instilled many good skills in me but probably the most important was a pre essay planning and the post essay revision she helped me to get my point across in a better and more articulate way. For example you can see this in an essay for "heart of darkness" when I was writing about the horror at first it was a simplistic look, it was just another detail in an paragraph. "Kurtz said the horror the horror as his final words this is another example..." But on further inspection I realized the gravity of what he was saying and the horror became all encompassing. So with further thought that simple statement grew to a paragraph "The horror the horror has a large implication, it is kurtz\'s final words and the gravity of this is not left unnoticed from the reader it has many implication further than the statement itself and it is multi purposed in its meaning...".

In this instance, I like to use a question to address the relevance between the idea and evidence. The technique I given by my high school English teacher to use questions in an argument or persuasive essay also doubles as a way to engage the audience. In one example, I tried to say this as my main sentence: "The dynamic role and relationships of mortal women of ancient Greece do not reflect that of their divine counterparts in which they revere." This addresses the topic, but a question could address it with a more expressive tone: "Athena, for example: the respected goddess known for wisdom and battle strategy.

I struggle with determining how specific ideas and information should be set up and structured in my body paragraphs. Rather than create a broad introduction that picks up on every point in my argument, followed by body paragraphs that are each designated to one of the points in my introduction, and then lastly followed by a conclusion that ties anything together---my paragraphs throughout my essays tend to be filled with jumbled points. Thus, my objective of the introduction becomes unclear. In high school, this problem was most prominent in my Document Based Questions (DBQ) in history class. DBQ essays provide a set of articles and a question. You are expected to answer the question using your own knowledge, while also referencing the provided documents. I felt overwhelmed with all of the information put in my direction and was incapable of dispersing all of the provided information and would instead jumble it all into two paragraphs or less. In response to my essays, my instructor continuously commented on the abundance of "fluff" surrounding direct quotes from the provided documents. My goal from taking INTD 106 is to increase my ability to understand documents and find my own interpretation about the topic to include in my writing. I strongly feel that this will also help me structure my essays because I will have more to say in my own words to fill an individual paragraph with. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ertunc Mumcuoglu ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing I always focus on is thoughtfully incorporating sophisticated language throughout my essay. I never allow myself to repeat certain words or use basic terms while evaluating the topic at hand. I like to do this to make every sentence fresh and engaging, which in turn elevates my paper by a great deal. I learned to do this from my father who, after every paper I wrote, would proof read each of them and guide me to improve my adjectives and word placement. For example, instead of saying \"Baldwin describes his bad experience he had growing up\", I would say \"Baldwin illustrates his painful upbringing with his paranoid father\". My father helped me heighten my use of the English language through thoughtful and insightful word placement and word choice. I now believe that I can create engaging and insightful papers due to this skill I have developed. But because of this, I now write incredibly strict and I am very hard on myself. I will not move on in a paper unless the sentence I just wrote has reached it\'s highest potential. This causes my papers to be much better obviously, but it creates an unnecessary time bulge, in which I take way too long writing my papers. Going forward I would like to improve on my stubbornness. I feel that since I write so precisely and deliberate, I a lot of times don\'t make changes to my papers and don\'t listen to any constructive criticism. I feel that my first drafts are always \"perfect\" and I need not to make any substantial changes, other than grammar or punctuation.

First off, I always use topic sentences to establish the idea of a paragraph, as a thesis would establish an essay's argument. For instance, last semester I stated topic sentences like: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}["Nationalism and imperialism justified militarism of European empires, leading to the war" and ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}["]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[At the same time, nationalism empowered smaller and recently independent nations to fight European empires, especially those in the Balkans." After, I would elaborate a bit, and provide an example(s) to prove my argument. Then, at the end of the paragraph, I would write a sentence that restated my point, but at the same time provided a transition to the next paragraph's argument. In addition to being a conclusion, it was like a pre-topic sentence, which I believe bolstered the transition. The reader had more time to absorb my argument. For instance, before I said "At the same time, nationalism empowered smaller and recently independent nations to fight European empires, especially those in the Balkans," in the previous paragraph (about national independence movements in the Ottoman empire) I asserted that "Self-determination was prominent in the Balkans, leading to anti-imperial sentiments." Hopefully, I will continue to emphasize structure, and boost my in-paragraph organization to make up for my clumsy wording.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Sometimes, I feel that the way I write can be convoluted. Once again, thanks to my high school English teacher it has improved; he taught me to use transitions like "furthermore" and "also" more often, and eliminate fluff like prepositions. Yet, part of me feels that my writing could employ more concise wording and fewer words per sentence. Sometimes, my sentences get unnecessarily long, with comma after comma. Finally, I always use a thesaurus and I never feel I can find the right word or phrase to use. Despite this, I'm sure with practice that my writing will improve in this regard.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: David Morrison ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my writing that I prioritize is the organization in the introduction of any piece I write. I believe that without a structured introduction it is hard to have a piece of writing that flows nicely and the data will seem haphazardly placed. A strong introduction sets the tone for any writing and organization is critical for success. I first became aware of this skill in high school when my AP English teacher equated a bad introduction as to building a pyramid with the top of the pyramid as the base. He explained that an introduction sets the foundation for the paper and I have used this thinking ever since that analogy. An example of this is I would initially start an introduction with the claim, "Through the dehumanization that Japanese Americans faced in internment camps we can see that it had a profound effect on their identity." Here I have a solid claim about the book I was reading, but really no direction. After revisions I would add "By looking at the classification of groups of people in the father's confession, we can see that the classifications took a unique identity and made them mundane through stereotyping. It is important to look at this aspect of the text because it shows the power of outward perception on identity itself." I believe that this addition provides a foundation for the paper I am about to write and sets the paper up for success. It also gives the paper direction early which helps information in a piece become more cohesive.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[For future writing, I would like to focus on the analysis of material I quote. I feel that sometimes I pick out a beautiful quote from an academic and simply just summarize what he/she said. I think sometimes I feel that there is no better way to convey the idea than that person's quote. However, I need to provide my insight on what the person is saying rather than just repeating what he/she said in a different manner. I hope to develop this by being more genuine when analyzing quotes by adding to the material rather than repeat it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Morgan ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} The aspect of writing I always focus on in my essays is my thesis statement. I consider it to be the most important part of writing because it helps me give my essay a structure to follow while also laying out my argument. I was good at arguing my points in essays but I was never able to structure my writing in a way that flowed well until my English teacher taught me a simple way to construct a thesis that my essay could then follow. I've used this method ever since and it has made writing a little bit easier for me. I used to be very vague in my statements, I would make it clear what side I was arguing for but I would never get too specific. When it came time to support my argument, the evidence would be all over the place with one or two sentences to explain how that information proved my point. Using my teacher's method, I learned to narrow down my ideas to a few specific points that I would use for my thesis that I could then elaborate on more deeply in the essay rather than just provide a bunch of broad, unconnected evidence. By having a more specific, structured thesis I was then able to have a more structured, organized essay. Instead of having a basic thesis that only tells the reader what side I favor, like "Though there are some threats associated with genetic engineering, the benefits outweigh the risks by far", by providing a short list of benefits, like \"\...the benefits of scanning for disease, producing better food and manufacturing medicine\...\" helps me be able to then focus the rest of my argument on those key points throughout the rest of the essay. One aspect of my writing I would like to develop more is my introductions. While my conclusions could also use some work, writing a good introduction for my essays has always been one of my biggest problems, even when I already have a thesis. I spend too much time trying to figure out a good way to get the reader's attention so I waste time that could be spent actually writing. I tend to skip the intro and write everything else first but I hope I can eventually move away from that. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Melissa Moore =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Melissa Moore]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106 Response 1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In past writing, I have always been focused on analyzing quoted evidence. I always have been really good and thorough about that, which has made my English papers really strong. I believe that if you can't completely analyze a piece of writing, there is no point in showing your understanding in your topic at all. In high school, my Government teacher always commented on my analysis and how strong it was, and even helped me increase that skill by teaching me how to intertwine my quotes and analysis, making my writing less choppy. I love learning new skills because no one is a perfect writer, and it is always good to make your writing better. Whenever a teacher in high school gave me writing advice, I always tried my hardest to incorporate it into my next pieces to make them better. When analyzing poetry, I was able to talk more about the meaning by using fragments of evidence rather than filling up my essay with the whole poem. For example, when analyzing ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Beginning ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[by James Wright I stated, "Mental images create an impression that help describe feelings. Wright uses imagery such as 'The moon drops one or two feathers into the field' to show nightfall. Night doesn't come quickly, it slowly falls into place, and the feathers slowly falling through the dark give the reader an image of what the setting looked like at this moment. Putting the reader in the place of the narrator helps the reader understand the emotions he is feeling." In this piece, I focused more on what the poet was trying to say, and I was successfully able to do this analyzing the work instead of simply summarizing his poem in my writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I want to learn how to use my analysis to construct arguments. I'm very good at analyzing themes, but when I am asked to argue a certain topic, or choose a side and debate that through writing, I find myself struggling. I can take a quote and do a good job explaining its meaning, but my writing would be so much better and stronger if I were to take those meanings and develop an opinion, or argument. To learn how to better develop arguments, I can start by arguing things that are more black and white, and then move onto topics that are more complicated and require better argumentative styles. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Words: 395]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jordan Moore ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on refinement in my writing to keep what is important for the reader to see. I used to over explain and add unnecessary information, which would cause the key points to be lost in a non concise text. I went to my high school English teacher for guidance and ended up rewriting every essay for the class twice to refine my papers into incisive texts full of sufficiently worked key points. This system of rewriting forced me to work on over explaining and ended up making me a better writer with useful skills, which is very helpful with college writing. An example of this is an email I had previously written, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Hi everyone, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Since Geneseo classes and activities are cancelled for today, we had to reschedule our rugby interest meeting.

Please stop by to check out what rugby is all about and meet the team! ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Jordan Moore"]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When revising an email, I focus on keeping it short and simple to get my points across. For the first paragraph, I could've rewritten it as, "Geneseo classes and activities have been cancelled for the day, meaning our rugby interest meeting will be rescheduled for a later date." Once I revise my texts, I reread them to make sure that is the most concise way to write out the key points. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I still have many skills to learn to develop my writing even further. I would like to direct my attention towards outlining papers in an effective manner. My essays can end up very unorganized with certain points out of place. If I concentrate more of my time on outlining before writing, I will have an easier time making sure all topics are lining up in an interesting and constructive way. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Holly Moore ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} 1. [As I write I usually focus strongly on the language I am using. I do a lot of synonym searches in formal essays to vary up the language because I find myself repeating a lot of key phrases or terms that may back up the thesis. Not only do I pay attention to language for essay assignments, but also for poetry or creative writing since it is a big part of making writing interesting. Last semester, in my creative writing class, I wrote a lot of poems and creative pieces and received a lot of compliments for my figurative language or savvy word choices. For example, in my final creative piece, I used "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Ella and I were about to be blessed by the gift of visual ecstasy." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[This originally was a bland statement like, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Ella and I were about to witness the meteor shower.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[" In order to make my writing more rich and interesting I had to build up to reveal the meteor shower and make it sound like something magical. This is always my hope, to keep my writing as interesting as it can possibly be, whether it is a fun creative piece or a boring history essay.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} 2. [Something I want to become better with, as straightforward as it sounds, is keeping consistent with my tenses. I often find myself switching between past and present or present and future. I don't always catch it, though, so I need to be careful with that. Many times, when I have other people read my works they notice the errors in tense so I think it is definitely helpful for other people to read my writing before I finalize it. It is funny because I took Latin for three years in high school and studied all six of the Latin tenses which you would think would make me more in tuned to differentiating. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Clara Mooney ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Clara Mooney Purposeful Reflection When I write I have the tendency to ramble on and elaborate ideas until there is a string of long and confusing run on sentences and the main point is sometimes overshadowed. When I first see the prompt to an essay I usually pour out all my initial ideas onto the paper and just those ideas sometimes fill an entire page, and then I shift through them and pick out pieces that will work together to the thesis. This was a strategy that I adapted to cope with my scattered thoughts and to not lose sight of the bigger picture as I write the whole piece. But teachers would always read through my too-long essays and acknowledge that although my analyses were in depth, they could be confusing as they were over indulgent. For example, on an article summary for sociology last semester I summarized a main point, "The author put the ideological process of 'blaming the victim' in American society into perspectives of why they occur and the approaches to addressing such social problems.". The professor commented that this was too vague, which is something I often do in an effort to leave a lot of room for me to later elaborate on and I usually end up having more than one thesis to explain, and my essays end up long and an entangled web of interconnected ideas instead of a polished piece. I went back and chose one out of my many options to write about and found that this made it easier on the reader to follow along and for me to write it since I was not overwhelmed with all the possibilities. Just from the first couple classes of INTD 105, the concepts of including a counter point to strengthen a claim in essays, and not just specifically argumentative ones, and the acceptance of using "I" to include yourself into the conversation are intriguing challenges. In the future I want to concentrate on simplifying essays without losing depth, and this includes knowing how to incorporate quotes so that their message is clear but that they don't end up being too long and lengthening my whole essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Laura Montes ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Since high school, one aspect of my writing that I focused on was writing more cohesively without "flowering" my words and paragraphs. This aspect of my writing became clear to me after various teachers gave me constructive feedback and told me that I wrote way too much without "getting to the point." From my point of view, I was writing various sentences to make my introduction and body paragraphs longer. But, truth be told, I was not being concise and this negatively affected my grades. Fortunately, I have been able to develop a system named, "1-1 Sandwich" which focuses on making sure any sentence I write makes sense with the one prior to it, and after it. Like a sandwich, I need to have a solid foundation and make sure any toppings are needed with the context of my writing. Today, I am consistently working on implementing this 1-1 Sandwich system in my writing, especially when writing various essays. An example of when I used this system was during a Philosophy essay. For my first version of this paper, I introduced it by saying, "A visit to the doctor seems as simple as can be. One makes an appointment, is examined by the doctor, given medical advice, and often leaves with a prescription. We usually only pay attention to the solution to our medical problem but we do not realize how the constant use of antibiotics negatively affects the efficacy of the product." However, after feedback from my professor, I needed to be more direct. Thus, I revised and wrote the following, "In case \#7, the author presents their reasoning behind the rise of antibiotic resistance due to the over usage of antibiotics throughout the years. At the start of the case study, the author introduces the idea that many doctors in the US are prescribing medications just to satisfy a patient's want for medicine to relieve pain, when in reality they may not need it." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue my Geneseo journey, I would like to keep on working on how to properly cite in MLA and Chicago formats. Though I learned this in high school, I believe it is now an imperative skill that I need to know when including quotes and information from outside sources. I look forward to going through that module on Canvas and working on it during my courses this semester. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ethan Molinari ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The skill I focus on most is having a strong, concise thesis and relevant support to assert my thesis. I believe this skill is perhaps the most important and sometimes the only difference between an amazingly well-written piece and a poor one. A weak thesis assures a weak argument which makes the purpose of the piece unclear and leads to a lack of credibility. In a paper I wrote regarding standardized tests, my thesis was quote, "Standardized tests should be a staple in education as they provide a multitude of benefits to students and the educational system as a whole, including the fact that they're reliable, useful for comparison and college assessment, and encourage students to work harder." This thesis is strong in that it sets the stage for the rest of the piece and allows the reader to clearly comprehend the argument I'm making. Specifically, the exact purpose that standardized tests serves and the value that it provides. This was always a skill that my past teachers stressed upon, even in subjects like History where we'd also be writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An aspect of writing I'd like to develop more efficiently would be my creativity. I operate very structure-oriented and have always been better at math than writing. I believe this is an important skill because I believe it's the driving force behind the best creations. The most amazing things that exist today such as amazon and tesla, were creations all manifested through leveraging the power of the most powerful muscle, the mind. If I can improve upon the ability to use the mind to create, my potential will be limitless. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Annaclaire Modico =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Something I focus on while writing papers is being able to use specific words that demonstrate the point I am trying to get across. Words are powerful, which is why it is necessary to use them to your advantage when making a claim. In order to do this you must understand who your audience is and what reaction you want from them. In high school, my AP Composition teacher had my class focus on identifying examples of ethos, logos and pathos while reading. This enabled me to pick out certain words or phrases that either evoked a certain emotion from me, made me trust the source or believe what they had to say. The more skilled I became at recognizing these various modes of persuasion, the better my own writing became. For example, if I want my reader to believe a statement, I tend to add a statistic. This gives my argument credibility that justifies what I had said. A well known example of credibility is stating, "4 out of 5 doctors recommend this product." The fact that a trusted source approves the product makes it more appealing. Learning to use the tools of ethos, logos and pathos enhanced my writing capabilities and made me more aware of helpful terminology to use.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [A key area I would like to focus on in the future is paraphrasing. It often takes me several attempts before I correctly paraphrase an idea. Paraphrasing is an essential part of writing and is necessary to ensure you are not unintentionally plagiarize someone else\'s work. I plan on doing several edits on my papers in order to confidently state that every word is my own.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brittany Misiaszek ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my years of writing in high school I focused on many things while writing whether it was an essay or just a quick response to something. One aspect of my academic writing that I already focus on consciously as I revise my drafts is always supporting my statements with evidence and facts. When I make a statement I was taught to always support it with evidence. If I was ever answering a question on a reading quiz it would always say "provide evidence". My english high school teacher would say there's no point in answering a question if you had no evidence to support it. Throughout my essays in high school you could never have too much evidence. You want the person reading your essay or your answer to a question to choose your side or believe you're correct. In high school I wrote an essay on vaccinations trying to persuade people they are beneficial rather than harmful. I stated my claim then I provided my claim with examples and facts that I found to persuade people that they are beneficial. Evidence that supports my claim was that vaccines can protect yourself and others around you. You don\'t want your loved ones or people you care about to obtain a disease from you. You don\'t want anything harmful spreading to them.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I want to work on as a writer and develop better as a student at Geneseo and beyond is learning how to argue better. I want to learn how to take an argument and discuss both sides of it but also talk about the side I take into depth. I want to develop better skills at talking about the opposing side. I can possibly start by looking at the opposing side more into depth than I already do and act like I chose that side.

Diction and syntax, in my opinion, make or break the essay. In an essay, there could be very important information and beautiful analysis, but if the word choice is poor and the sentence structure is poor, then the essay does not flow, and I feel as if your true meaning does not come across. Below, I have attached my college application essay in which I discussed it with my former AP Literature teacher Mr. Gorman, and diction and the syntactical element of my writing was the main part of it that I needed to fix. Once I fixed it, I went to see him again and he then proceeded to exclaim how fantastic it is now. Writing with proper diction and syntax complements the analysis and takes papers to the next level. One aspect that I want to improve here at Geneseo and furthermore is my analysis techniques. The way I analyze quotes and passages now is substantial; however, I know I am capable of more, and I cannot wait to analyze at the highest caliber. Being able to analyze and analyze well would prove myself even more as a writer. I am unsure as to exactly what I want my career to be, but I know for a fact I will need to analyze from writing to charts to all sorts of things. "A shiver encapsulates my body as a cool crisp breeze thrusted its way through my sweat-stained cotton shirt; I wait anxiously with thoughts buzzing around my head, aching cramps enveloping my legs, heart beating uncontrollably." Words like the ones highlighted are not the most sophisticated words, but they provide visuals. These words encapsulate the five senses, and they allow my writing to come to life. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Samantha Minnehan =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing academically I consciously focus constructing a concise thesis statement because that is how I establish what the main concept of the piece. If the thesis is too long winded or jumbled the purpose of the essay gets lost and can make the main points seem unrelated. I am certain that I can display conciseness in my statements because when learning to write them in my AP English we learned a several step process to write them one of those steps including checking for conciseness. These steps make my thesis logical and understandable each time. One example would be that I check for clarity after writing the thesis for the first time originally I had "These types of arguable information can cause productivity amongst stubborn issues that struggle to make forward progress because of the discomfort they cause." After using the steps to make it more concise I wrote: "Disturbing images and controversial news should not be concealed despite the fact that they have the power to make people uncomfortable." The original thesis and the revised thesis are making the same point that controversial information should still be shared, but the original is too long and goes into too much detail; it reveals too much for just being the thesis. The revised statement says the same thing in fewer words and reads much easier. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [For the future of my academic writing, I would like to concentrate on my grammar and formatting. I do not think I know when to use certain types of punctuation and I am not familiar with many forms of writing styles such as MLA and APA. I normally just follow formatting instructions given to me but the details fall through the crack. To improve on this I could formally teach myself all the components of a few regularly used styles. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Eliza Milstead ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I am writing and revising my drafts for papers and projects I focus on descriptive language and explaining my points and arguments thoroughly. I try and be as descriptive as possible because I feel that if someone else is reading my paper or looking at an assignment of mine it really helps to know as much as possible about the topic I am discussing as I do. If the point of my paper is not as described as it potentially could be, people lose interest and do not actually become enticed by the material they simply just read through it. Descriptive language was first emphasized to me by an old writing assignment I had in my ninth grade. My teacher made us describe in detail a photo of an apple on the smartboard. At first I stated "the apple is large and red", and when we went over the responses by the whole class she said how boring we sounded and uninterested and that made her bored. So when asked to try again my response was "the apple is red with a white gleam along the side, its stem is a lovely dark brown, and it looks fresh and ripe".

I find that whenever I write essays or research papers, I always look for evidence that would be efficient with explaining further what i\'m writing about. To me, this skill is essential in writing because it helps expedite the claim or argument that I am trying to prove. In addition, it allows for there to be a debate on whether or not people agree with my claim. Providing evidence gives more definition to my writing, it shows that I know and done research on what I am talking about. For example, in my english class in high school, my teacher gave us an assignment where we had to read two books, create assertions that combined the ideas of both books and then provide evidence from both books that supported my assertions and countered them. The books we read were ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Man]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ by Irving Wallace and ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Caucasia]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ by Danzy Senna; one of my claims was that both books portrayed how judgment from others can cause people to look deeper into who they are and the actions they take. My evidence from one of the books was "'Our tradition', she said, looking directly at me, 'is that at the end of each class, everyone stands and says, 'black is beautiful'\... When it was my turn, I stood, my fingers clenched the cloth of my skirt, and my voice quavered: 'black is beautiful?' It had come out more like a question.. I heard one boy- say into his cupped hands, 'guess you must be ugly." (Senna, 44-45). ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [With my writing, I feel that I need to improve on explaining in detail how the evidence is relevant to my claim or my writing in general. I usually add in my evidence and explain what it is saying but I feel like I do not explain the evidence thoroughly enough in my own words or in a way that is more in depth.

A major critique I used to receive on graded writing assignments was that I wasn't using sophisticated vocabulary as I should be. Since then, I have done my best looking for synonyms that I believed could fit the situation better than the ones I have already used. For example, I wrote an analysis on a poem I read last year in my AP English class. I was tasked with identifying the specific elements of romantic era poetry that could also be found in a poem by William Wordsworth. A sentence that could use revising goes as follows, " "I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud" proves to be a perfect divide between new ideals, philosophies, and old romantic ideals." In this sentence I used the word "ideals" twice, which is considered an unsophisticated way of getting my point across. In the future I could change the sentence to say " "I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud" proves to be a perfect divide between new ideals, *romantic philosophies, and traditional styles of writing.*" Changing only a few simple words to more mature and refined terms allowed my sentence to sound more elaborate. Throughout my writing at Geneseo I hope to develop my writing to be more sophisticated and learn how to write more professionally overall. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Patrycia Mikiciuk =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Whenever I am writing an essay, I always keep in mind the requirements of the instructor. Prior to writing the draft of an essay, I highlight the main points that the instructor wants within the essay. Featured points that I have written in the past are central themes, tone, illusions, etc. Personally, I structure my works of writing based on those requirements. After gathering my research on an essay, I'll outline approximately how many paragraphs I will write about for each requirement. Writing paragraphs based on what the instructor demands are how I am able to easily keep track of my progress. During the revision process, I go back and mark off if the requirements were met in a satisfactory condition, meaning that I have explained my thoughts completely. Senior year of high school, I was assigned a final project for English. I choose the research paper option and although the paper was very strenuous due to the amount of material that had to be met. My instructor was highly impressed with the paper and told me in person about a week later that he enjoyed reading it and I received a 100% on the paper. He enjoyed how detailed and thorough I was in my writing. As I furtherance my journey at Geneseo I am looking forward to developing strong transitions and fluidity in my writing. As of today, I continue to struggle with developing strong and logical transitions. Formulating transition statements in between paragraphs is challenging for me because I lack the confidence in my writing ability. I am fully aware of the fact that I must devise an essay that flows together, but I am unable to figure out a way to write a transition sentence without making it seem out of place. Often times, I find myself completing a body paragraph and as I move on to the next one, I realize that I have to write a transition statement. However, whenever I try to write the sentence, I do not feel confident enough because the sentence does not fit in with what I previously mentioned in the paragraph. Therefore, I tend to leave out the transition since I think it disrupts the main purpose of the paragraph. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Karissa Michel ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I struggle and focus on my repetition the most. I find myself most times circling around the main point and repeating things I have previously said. As I go through and edit my writing I fix these mistakes and try to better get at my main point in fewer sentences. "Stability is the goal of most if not all governments, obviously, most governments want to last and keep power. Tokugawa Ieyasu was the first shōgun of the Tokugawa Shogunate, and had unified Japan and created a lasting government." Before my revision, the section that was in between these two sentences was just a repetition of things I had already stated. I think getting rid of the extra sentences makes the reader more engaged in the reading. Although my essay was meant to be long, there are no extra and unnecessary repetitive sentences. Previous professors have commented on how my responses now are always to the point with just the right amount of information. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like to I would like to work on incorporating more voice into my writing. I think a piece of writing becomes more interesting for the reader to read when there is some voice in it. I also think being able to use the right amount of voice in the appropriate environment is difficult. Maybe instead of always incorporating the author\'s voice through various quotes, I could add some of my own and explain what I think about the quotes. Also by adding new words that will catch the readers eye, and make the writing flow.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ian Merrihew ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing which I try to focus on consciously is the use of proper grammar. I am always sure to proofread my essays before submitting them because, regardless of how well-researched a paper is, or how thoroughly a paper analyzes its topic, if a paper is riddled with grammatical errors it will not only result in a lower grade than could have otherwise been achieved, but any insights it may contain are likely to be overlooked due to the paper's lack of readability. I had an English teacher in tenth grade who was, seemingly, very passionate about grammar. We were assigned weekly grammar homework, which she would grade mercilessly. In addition, she would take one point off of our essays for each grammatical error they contained. Although I may not have been a huge fan of this this teacher at the time, I look back fondly on her class because it left me with a sense of the importance of proper grammar. I vividly remember being handed back a paper which was covered in red marks and had a big 81 written on the top. I had neglected to attend any of her afterschool proofreading sessions, which, upon receiving the graded paper, I realized I could have benefitted from. This wasn't the last "B" paper I wrote in high school, but, having learned the importance of proofreading, I can say with certainty that it was the last "B" I received on an essay as a result of my grammatical ineptitude. In the future, I would like to use more sources for my research papers. I have a tendency to use the first handful of articles that come up on a google search of the topic, and I feel that this limits the depth of my essays. By setting aside more time to find sources, I believe that I will not only be able to write more thorough research papers, but I will gain a deeper understanding of the research topic as well. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mackenna Mercurio =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Mackenna Mercurio ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I understand my writing is not perfect. Though as I work to better myself, one aspect I stress the most and push the hardest at improving is my analysis. It has always been prominent in my mind that analysis is key to strong writing. This is due to my 12th grade English class. My teacher Mrs Arnold, who structured my learning in a way making me want to improve. She taught me that analysis shows the reader what the writer knows and understands about the work(s) that they are referring to and gives the writer a chance to develop a voice. While discussing the book ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ by Ken Kesey in an essay built to discuss the characters influence on one another, I wrote in analysis with one of my quotes, "Although the gesture was miniscule and did not have much of an effect on the Nurse, this example connects Bromden and McMurphy and reveals that they both want the same detrimental outcome against the Nurse together". This example senses I understood the quote and was able to discuss it further through my essay in a way that related to my thesis. A skill like this is important so the reader and writer stay on the same page throughout the essay and get an idea of what is most relevant in the writer's eyes when attempting to comprehend and apply evidence from the text. A final example is, "McMurphy's constant buggery of the nurse with the support of Bromden reveal the breaking down of her mentally and reduce her to a feeling of nothing with no real purpose. This was Bromden's end goal". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [It is evident in some of my writing however, that I have a hard time with keeping my grammar fluent throughout my work. I believe I make mistakes that even if I have proofread I do not catch them all myself or understand the ones that are corrected due to ignorance. I am afraid I make mistakes that I do not even realize are wrong. A way to possibly go about fixing this is to ask friends, the writing learning center, and/or professors as I go about writing so that I can fix my major mistakes and prevent them in the future. It will be a process but I think with devotion and focus I will work through my grammatical difficulties.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(398 words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Althea Mensing ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Althea Mensing I focus greatly on making sure I have a clear thesis statement, both in the introduction and the conclusion of my writing. My high school English teacher stressed very much that every piece of writing has a concrete and foundational purpose, and the thesis statement should show that purpose. Most of the writing pieces I completed in high school were book summaries and research papers. I very much enjoy writing research papers, especially on topics I feel passionate about and feel the need to inform others on. However, I would like to improve my skills on this type of paper because at times, I focus too much on my own opinions and at times my writing can seem biased. For example, in an argumentative essay I completed my senior year of high school regarding legalizing medical marijuana, I focused too much on my own opinion and as a result my paper became very one-sided and biased. Along the same lines, I would like to improve the overall cohesiveness of the papers I write, both research based and summary based. I would also love to expand my vocabulary when writing papers. At times, I find it difficult to come up with synonyms for common words used often in some papers I've written, such as "very" or "important". I tend to repeat myself while writing, and coming up with better synonyms for words I like to use could definitely make my writing better and more intellectual. For example, instead of making a statement of \"the Carlisle Indian School served as a very important monument for students who attended\", I would like to improve my vocabulary use and improve the sentence as \"the Carlisle Indian School served as a tremendously crucial monument for students who attended\". Lastly, I would like to improve myself when it comes to writing conclusions. I find conclusion statements rather difficult because I do not want to repeat statements I've made in my introduction, and I want it to flow more cohesively with the rest of my writing. For example, I often start my conclusions with a simple opening sentence such as \"In conclusion..\", but I think a better way of starting off a concluding statement could be \"All in all\...\" or \"To summarize\...\". A clear and cohesive conclusion to end all my papers in the future would greatly improve my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Franco Melito =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I consciously focus on when I revise my drafts is the structure of each sentence and paragraph. When I write the first draft of a paper or essay, I follow an outline about the general topics I want to discuss in each paragraph. However, at times, the sentences within the paragraph need rearrangement or the grammar within the sentence is awkward. For instance, last semester in Western Humanities I, I wrote a paper about Christian ethics and the power of faith. In one of the paragraphs, my concluding sentence was awkward and grammatically incorrect: "Overall, in order to keep people in line because of their innate nature to sin, which is the concept of original sin, God and the authors of the Bible made the Christian code of ethics very demanding." To make this sentence appealing and understandable, during the revision process with the help of the Writing Learning Center in Milne library, I rearranged the parts of the sentence without changing the basic theme I was trying to convey. "Overall, God and the authors of the Bible made the Christian code of ethics very demanding because it is the innate nature of humans to sin and go against God; which is also called original sin." The sentence is more concise and flows better with the rest of the essay. An aspect of academic writing that I would like to improve on this semester is organizing evidence to use in my papers and then thoughtfully analyzing it. Often when I analyze the evidence I use to support my thesis, I directly regurgitate what the evidence says and lose my own voice in the paper. The resulting product is an essay without thoughtful analyses and a reduction of my own interpretations on the topic. To fix this problem, I could shift my focus on connecting the evidence to the thesis statement instead of attempting to explain or interpret what the evidence says. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Olivia McNeil =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing there are a few skills that I focus on, with the primary being the integration and establishment of a thesis. A thesis statement provides a few things in ones writing. It provides clarity of the subject matter to the reader, in addition to solidifying the key points being made. Knowing this I prioritize the clear establishment of my thesis at the ending of my introductory paragraph. And to increase the strength and clarity of my writing I then relate all of my points back to the thesis. If not for doing these things the reader would have very little idea of what the point to the writing is let alone be able to connect the various points being made. During my senior year, I took an english course that combined AP Literature and Composition and a college level writing course through a local community college. My instructor was the one who engraved the importance of a thesis to myself and my classmates until it became second nature to us. Without a thesis an introductory paragraph would sound much like " Perspective is something that varies from person to person, this is a statement that applies as well to perspective on justice. Faulkner\'s "Barn Burning" contrasts the moral ideals and perspectives on justice between Sarty and Abner through the literal act of burning barns". However when enhanced by a thesis that becomes, " Perspective is something that varies from person to person, this is a statement that applies as well to perspective on justice. Faulkner\'s "Barn Burning" contrasts the moral ideals and perspectives on justice between Sarty and Abner through the literal act of burning barns. ... Faulkerns conflicting point of view, hard tone and tactile imagery evoke the distant feeling of Sarty and Abner's relationship". By simply adding that thesis statement the purpose and context of the writing became much clearer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My hopes for INTD 105 and 106 are that I leave with a better understanding of how to better my punctuation.

When writing an essay, the first thing I do is find good sources that have good information for valuable sources. I like it when the example makes sense and matches my thesis. I have also received feedback from teachers in high school stating the importance of valuable sources. Once I find a good example, I match the rest of my sentences to make sure that example fits well into my paper. While writing about discrimination on homosexuality in sociology I mentioned the example, \"But still a third of them do not dare to talk to colleagues about it. This could be because, according to the study, three-fourths of those who are open about their sexuality have experienced some kind of discrimination in Germany.\" This example is relevant to my thesis for my essay. I believe that good evidence makes your paper stronger. While attending Geneseo, I would like to become a better writer. One way I could do this is by adding more detail into my explanations towards my thesis. Many of my teachers in high school would express to me the lack of detail I use in my thesis. I believe I can become better at adding more detail and arguing my point in the essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ryan McMullen =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [What I focus on the most as I revise my draft is the proper punctuation and grammar throughout the essay. Since I was young, I have always struggled with punctuation and grammar. Since I was made aware of this problem by my mother, who is a High School English teacher. I have made sure it is what I focus on the most while revising my essay. I look for run on sentences, improper commas, periods and dashes. Also, I make sure I quote everything perfectly, So it is not considered plagiarism. Here is an example of proper punctuation in an essay I had wrote. \"Over the course of History African Americans have been treated poorly, they have faced discrimination, racism, and segregation. They were denied basic civil rights due to the color of their skin. During this time period, many African American authors have written about their struggles and hardships.\" Here is the same sentence without proper punctuation: \"Over the course of History African Americans have been treated poorly they have faced discrimination, racism, and segregation. They were denied basic civil rights due to the color of their skin during this time period many African American authors have written about their struggles and hardships.\". For plagiarism]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[, I will use quotes from an INTD essay I have just recently done: This would be the proper way to site a quote from a book "Sometimes I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It\'s beyond me"(Hurston 117). This would be the improper way to site a quote from a book: "There is not a Negro alive who does not have this rage in his blood". Like I had said earlier, It is important you properly quote, so you will not be accused of plagiarism. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward I would like to focus on, my thesis statement and linking it throughout my essay. I believe this is important because I really would like to drive my point across to the reader. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Colleen McMullen ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing academically, I make a point to include adjectives and other descriptive words that illuminate my essay's tone and stance. I believe it is important to create a consistent tone in an essay, to better reflect the objective of the essay itself. In order to achieve this, I typically focus on simply communicating my thoughts in a first draft; not particularly focused on using elevated language. I then review my first draft, and use a thesaurus to replace elementary words with ones that hold more impact. I learned the importance of this skill from my high school English teacher, who would constantly provide the class with example of two essays communicating the same points, but with different word choices. The overall strength of the two essays varied greatly, which reinforced the necessity of making proper word choices. I often reference these packets from high school to find ways to elevate my own writing. For example, in a first draft I wrote "The family is not rich or dignified enough to be accepted by high society" simply attempting to communicate my thought. After putting my initial ideas to paper, I then revised the sentence to "The Bennet's moderate wealth and merely adequate propriety make them unworthy of the true English elite." Through this change, I attempt to better communicate my point, as well as achieve a more academic tone. In the future, I hope to lessen my writing's propensity to be long-winded. I typically struggle to use concise language that properly communicates my point quickly, which leads my essays to be unnecessarily long. I would love to be able to express my views in a more efficient manner, without superfluous sentences. While I do believe it is important to expand on my thoughts to ensure they are properly understood, there does become a point in which expansion becomes digression.\ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Madeleine McLaughlin ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my academic writing, I focus most on crafting an intriguing introduction that quickly captures the reader's attention and pulls him or her into the piece. I believe this technique is especially important in academic literature (as opposed to creative writing or storytelling), because of the traditionally bland nature of this form of writing. In my most recent research paper, about the state of gender parity in Africa, I started the introduction with the following: "Gloria was 12 years old when she was taken out of school and married to a 35-year-old man." To me, this opening was far more attention-getting than my original sentence: "There are thousands of school-aged girls in Africa who face the immense challenge of gaining a formal education." While the second sentence certainly had a place in the paper, it was more suited for a paragraph further into the writing. In the future, I would like to work on freewriting, the ability to write my thoughts quickly and without judgement. Too often I feel pressure to make each word and sentence perfect, without need for further revision. But this process is most likely far slower and more arduous than acknowledging and accepting the imperfections of a first draft. In essence, I hope to write faster and with less judgement. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Connor Mclaughlin =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One of the things I have come to realize about my writing process is that I need to actually work on drafts of my works. I\'ve never been the kind of writer who needs to work on a draft to solidify my work, I usually just write what comes to mind and go with that. The couple of times I have worked on a draft, I generally end up editing a lot of what I write, as I become a bit self concious about how I write and what I\'m writing about. I tend to get into my own head about works I do and overthink things, which is one of the main reasons why I don\'t write drafts of my work. However, one of the things I tend to excel at when doing academic writing is taking a topic and expounding on said topic. It\'s something that has always come naturally to me. The latest example of that would be my essay for my English final in high school. I ended up writing about 3 pages on a topic that I honestly can\'t even remember fully. I believe it had something to do with relating a few short stories we were given, and giving examples of how these short stories related to a central topic we were given. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Melanie McGuire ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I tend to focus a lot on my word choice in my essays and other types of work. Whenever I am revising my work I always look through and try to find words that repeat a lot or words that could be a less generic. For example, I always start my sentences with a new word to make it less choppy and sound better. Also, I would replace words like; good, sad, happy with words like; exceptional, sorrowful, cheerful. I have always been taught that while revising to sit with a thesaurus to really spice up the word choice. My teachers have always taught me that the words you use could really leave an impact on the reader. In a recent essay I wrote it stated, "There is so much sadness and disarray in young prince Hamlet's life that it effects his mental state in a negative way. It is as if Hamlet's mind and heart are being toyed around with because he does not know who to trust or how to act." Originally, I used the word chaos instead of disarray which I feel like is generic and used a lot, so the word disarray is something new and I said chaos a lot in this essay also. Also, I originally said his mind and heart are confused and I feel as though toyed around with is a better phrase that fits better. One aspect I want to develop better while studying at Geneseo is my use of punctuation. I feel as though I know how to use the generic, easier punctuation but still get confused where to place certain things. I think that punctuation would help the flow of my writing. I would also like to strengthen my citing skills. I feel as though I was taught how to cite so long ago and could use a bit of a refresher as I continue my education. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: James McGlynn =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [James McGlynn]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Feb 10 2018 ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106 ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I focus most on crafting a well thought out and concise thesis statement that can fit within a single sentence because it contains the main argument of my essay and tells my reader why to read the piece in the first place. Having a thesis that is convoluted and chaotic can easily confuse a reader and leave them unsure of what my argument really is. When I write a thesis that is easy to follow and contained within a single, recognizable sentence I allow my reader to study my piece of writing with an understanding of the point I'm trying to reach. My freshman year of high school I found that my thesis writing needed serious work, and through a series of essays that year I began to improve by simply reducing most of my theses to a simple cause and effect relationship that I could easily work into my introductory paragraphs as opposed to my habit of creating a series of sentences that culminated in a hard to follow thesis. Instead of writing my thesis like this, "There are many perspectives through which to understand the Saudi-Iranian conflict, such as realism, liberalism, and constructivism. However, only structural realism provides a readily understandable set of assumptions that can help us understand the Saudi-Iranian conflict without significant cause for confusion. These consist of an anarchical international system and the idea of self interested states", I make an effort to construct my theses like this, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[While there are many perspectives from which we can understand the Saudi-Iranian conflict, structural realism offers a readily understandable set of assumptions and outcomes, such as the idea of an anarchical international system, that allow us to break down and understand a conflict in the most complex region in the world of international politics". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future I want to improve my implementation of proper evidence and quotations into my writing in order to make it a more seamless addition to my writing.

I think that elaborating them well makes the reader think about what I said. Also, explaining quotations help me think of new ideas that make my writing grow. Right before the state English exams in middle school, my teachers would always teach us awareness to introduce, cite, and explain quotations in our writing. Also, in the book ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[They Say, I Say]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, for INTD 105 that Professor Lima is having us read, they also include that explaining quotations in hard to do. Now they include templates of how easy it really is. Last semester, an essay that I wrote received an 95. But re-reading it, I realize mistakes that I made that could make it flow better. An example of explaining quotations in my writing is "These irregular conditions felt by works may have been because of a trouble changing in accordance with new conditions. This goes back to urbanization because demand outweighed supply." I always try to connect the quote back to the beginning and always take the overall picture since you need the whole idea without contradicting your argument. I need to take the time and effort to pay attention to quotation and make sure they are supporting my argument. The templates in the ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[They Say, I Say]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ book may help, but I shouldn't be using these templates as I get older. It should be apart of my writing by them. From here on out, I would like to focus on clearing up my language in my writing. After I finish a long paper, I always feel frustrated when I realize that only one word can make my writing much clearer. My papers usually include the same words multiple times in a paper. It feels very redundant and boring if I do this so often. Also, I do major editing for all of my papers and I see the same errors of punctuation and grammar.

With the help of wise elders and teachers, I have learned how to correctly and effectively craft my writing. One thing that I had always admired about my writing was my ability to integrate advanced vocabulary words into my pieces. For example, in essays I wrote before starting my education at The State University of New York at Geneseo, I used a variety of vocabulary words such as lascivious, obliged, and lavish. I presented these words in a logical way, and surrounded them with context clues, so that a reader who was not familiar with the word could still understand what I was saying. After being assigned a satirical essay, I discovered that I was very good at adjusting to different writing styles. For this particular essay, I employed sarcasm to show that since women joined the workforce, it has changed for the better: "Gertrude B. Elion, an educated woman, nearly ruined the medical field. Her extensive knowledge on the drug azidothymide hardly amounted to anything --- it just became an instrumental part of first drug to be used for the treatment of AIDS.

It is important to me that I follow an outline to make my essay the best it can be. To be sure that my work looks and reads professionally, I always make sure that my thesis is stated in my introduction paragraph. For example, when writing my introduction paragraph to an essay about well-being based from the book, *Sociology of Well-Being Lessons from India,* by Steve Derné I would be sure to include my thesis statement, "Considering my mother's religious approach to her cancer suggests Derné rightly recognizes that having an approach to ill health contributes to well-being. Derné rightly recognizes that having an approach to ill health contributes to well-being but fails to recognize how easy that is related to religious faith." By putting my thesis statement at the end of the introduction paragraph, it reassures the topic and tone for the remaining parts of my essay. It is important to display to the reader what they are going to be reading about. Having the thesis in the introduction paragraph makes it clear what the essay is going to be about. Next, in the body paragraphs, it is important to have clear points and examples followed by detailed explanations. This is a key aspect in any essay because you want the reader to have a clear understanding of the ideas you are attempting to display. Finally, for the conclusion paragraph, it is essential to restate the thesis statement along with giving any additional knowledge that supports the topic. This helps the reader get a better understanding of the information they just read and also close the paper professionally. In addition to these main three guide lines I prefer to follow, when writing an academic paper, it is important to broaden your everyday vocabulary. In the future I plan to heighten my vocabulary by using a thesaurus to find words that sound more sophisticated. The use of sophisticated words will help to heighten the level of the essay and overall make the paper sound better. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Marianne Maysuch ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my high school and college career I have received very helpful feedback that has shaped me to become the writer I am today.

I always try to start off with a hook so that the first sentence grabs the reader\'s attention. For Example, "Millions of Americans say they fear public speaking, but imagine singing and dancing in front of hundreds of people." After grabbing their attention I get more specific and clarify what the essay will focus on. "This is what I have been doing since I have been 5 years old."

My sophomore year of high school, my English teacher has inspired to invest in my writing and my growth. He critiqued my adolescent and informal writing to sound sophisticated and well thought-out; however, there is always room for improvement. I am confident in my organizational and analytical skills. I have adopted ways to integrate pieces of evidence pretty smoothly. For example, when Maya Angelou had said, "What are you looking at me for? I didn't come up to stay..." she had inserted her own dialogue into the essay of "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" (342). The integration of quotes is vital in presenting your supporting evidence in a paper. As a developing writer, I strive to achieve fluidity in my writing. There are times where my sentences can be short and not elaborate enough. During my time in Geneseo, I hope to increase the level of sophistication and have more ideas flow onto the paper that I am writing. I have trouble memorizing all of the grammar rules and would gladly like to polish those errors. Lastly, having my own creative voice in my writing is an area that needs improvement. I have yet to find a style of writing that speaks to me. I hope to incorporate my own thoughts into my writing to agree or disagree with any other work from someone else. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Claire Martin =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} My main focus regarding academic writing has been making sure my punctuation is correct and makes overall sense in the format of the text I'm writing. This is an important aspect in general since a basic foundation of how words should be strung together is the basis of writing itself. Through the entirety of high school, I would hate seeing red marks that were grammar and punctuation related; I always thought proper punctuation was such a simple task. My first time truly learning about the usage of semi-colons and commas together was where my turning point was and things eventually clicked. My AP Literature teacher always encouraged me to shorten my sentences with punctuation or link together two relating statements to make an even stronger argument. For example, in my essay on *The Awakening* by Kate Chopin, I utilized these skills: "Edna has a lot of privilege in her life but despite this**,** she's not satisfied. We'll give her some slack**;** she never truly loved her husband**,** she never had the desire to have children and ends up having three**,** and she's not getting what she wants out of her life." At first, I had a run on sentence that sounded clunky and ruined the flow of my essay. Once I cut that sentence into two separate clauses and strung them together with a semi-colon, the statement became much more fluid. My main goal is to get to a point where I am 100% confident in my punctuation skills. It's a journey, but I have grown throughout it. On the other hand, I would like to improve my knowledge of making my conclusions stronger. I've struggled with this throughout high school; whipping through an intro and multiple body paragraphs only to find that I don't know what my final statement should be. This was, and continues to be a grueling process in my writing. I think easing the complexity of conclusions could be solved by thinking about the end in the beginning and planning how I want the reader to inevitably feel. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Chris Martello ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I focus on is not using contractions. This is a very important rule to follow when writing because the use of contractions in serious academic essays can make a person look unprofessional, and unintelligent. An aspect of writing that I need to focus on would be setting a thesis for my papers and expanding on it with multiple examples. Using the most recent essay I have written for a Theater 100 level class I noticed that both of these aspects were present. I was very diligent in my revisions about eliminating all use of contractions, but I away from the thesis of my paper making it a little confusing for the reader. During my freshman year of high school, my English teacher noticed that I used contractions on a very regular basis in my writing. He told me that it was something that I had to eradicate from my writing as soon as possible, and from then on, I have always been extremely conscious of my use of contractions. In terms of my inability to stay on topic and stick to my thesis statements in papers, I believe that I will be able to learn to do it, and that it will come with time and experience. One strategy I believe will help me accomplish this is making my thesis statement more specific so that I have less topics I can write about which I believe will keep me on topic while I write. For example, the type of theses I have been writing would be, the ocean is extremely vast. This is a very vague statement that could lead me in many different directions. An example of more in depth thesis would be, The ocean is home to thousands of different species of wildlife, and less explored by humans than outer space. I believe that by working on my weaknesses and continuing to be conscious of my strengths I will become a better writer. Not using contractions and staying on topic are two very important aspects of writing in my opinion. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mikayla Marowski ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing, the most important skill that I focus on is making sure that my work is specific. By specific, the idea that my writing should have a tight hold on an idea that flows throughout the paper, without making the writing have too broad of an idea. This skill is important because it starts with the thesis statement, when a thesis statement and specific and narrowed down to center idea, the rest of the paper will be able to fit in the same way. Creating a base with the thesis that is then used to keep the paper in line when it comes to drafting any writing. My high school english teacher for our college english class was the one that truly taught me to write this way. I am able to work through my thesis and create something that is focused rather than lots of ideas combined. Although, I was also taught to make sure that the thesis was never too narrow in the sense that there is still room to spread and expand ideas within my writing. An example being, "everybody has bad days sometimes," this statement is way too broad to fit as a thesis statement. While on the other hand, "I had a bad day yesterday," is too narrow, it would be impossible to write a paper when all of the information was already stated in one sentence. It is able finding the happy medium, "Every time I have a bad day, I learn something about myself." I use this way of thinking as a skill that helps to form and format my entire writing as a whole. It is important to learn new skills when it comes to writing because everyone has different ways of looking at things, for instance, I was able to truly understand this way of writing during my senior year of high school. I would also like to learn to concentrate on using a larger variety of sources in my writing. Rather than only choosing something from a specific novel to talk about, i could enhance my knowledge and my writing by doing research and also placing that in my writing to give the reader a better understanding. I could do this through the idea of thinking outside the normal ideas for evidence and researching other ways of going about an idea that I am specifically writing about. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nicolette Marciana ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I write, I try to focus on vocabulary. Having a good vocabulary in my writing makes my writing more sophisticated and allows me to communicate my ideas using words that are the most fitting and appropriate for what I'm trying to say. I developed my vocabulary during high school when I had to write weekly timed essays in my AP Literature class. My English teacher told me that good vocabulary can enhance your argument by using words with more weight and depth than the simpler language that we use conversationally. He also said that the best way to develop your vocabulary is by reading regularly and getting exposure to words I wouldn't normally know or use. Now that I'm in college, I am held to a higher standard of sophistication in my writing. It is important to show advanced vocabulary in my writing without making it seem like I used an online thesaurus for every word, because if I do that I lose my voice in my writing. ]{.s1} [[ ]{.Apple-tab-span}An example of my writing in a paper from my bioethics class is "Emmanuel is aware that his views and plans will receive an influx of opposition." I could have said "Emmanuel is aware that his views and plans will receive a lot of opposition." The word "influx" is more sophisticated and also adds more weight to how controversial Emmanuel's ideas were. "Influx" gives the notion of a "flood" of opposition.]{.s1} [[ ]{.Apple-tab-span}Hereafter, I want to work on the organization of my ideas and paragraphs. I have trouble making my ideas flow, especially when writing an argumentative essay. When I get feedback on my writing, I'm usually told that my ideas can get "all over the place." If I want to express my ideas clearly, I need to organize my ideas better and figure out which details are most relevant to my argument. Planning my essays on a separate paper beforehand may help me with this.]{.s1} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Vimbayi Mandizha ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One important aspect of writing that I think about actively as I revise drafts is how I make the conclusion not only end the piece and reiterate how all the points I made in the body paragraphs relate back to the thesis but also provide a new understanding. It's important for the conclusion to serve as closure, but in order to truly convince or leave an impact on the reader, it's also necessary to end with something signifying a clear and fresh point of view, outlook, or way of addressing the thesis and arguments. I learned this skill in eighth grade, with my English teacher explaining how it made the conclusion less redundant. My personal college essay's developments highlight the difference between a weaker conclusion and a strong one. In reference to how moving around a lot in my childhood shaped me and prepared me well for college as a biology major, the first draft reads, "In conclusion, my experiences moving and living in different areas are meaningful enough to include in my application, not only because of the positive traits and abilities I've gained, but also because these traits and abilities are essential for college\....As I grow older and continue to develop, I become more grateful for my mixed past and look forward to what my future holds." After many revisions, the fifth and final draft reads, "With the aspects of change and discovery considered, I believe my moving experiences prepare me well for a future in science\...People move to new locations to find opportunity and improve the future. Scientists work with the same goals in mind\...I'd be grateful for experiences and resources that would not only help prepare me further as a scientist, but would also continue to help me adapt to new situations, change for the better, and discover more from the world around me." The latter conclusion is clear, more direct, and leaves the reader with something to dwell on while also concisely addressing each point made in the essay.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One skill I would like to improve is analyzing sources to help support my arguments. I sometimes don't pick the strongest pieces of texts to support the arguments, or I do pick strong ones but don't show how they support my thesis in the best way. A way I could improve with this is more active reading and definitely writing more drafts.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(399 words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emma Mandella =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing, I focus primarily on creating a well-supported thesis for my essay. I find that doing so makes the writing process generally easier, because the thesis allows me to tie together all of my ideas within a paper around one common thread. This way, I can eliminate any ideas that seem inconsistent with the topic of the paper, and end up with a more focused essay. When I was in high school, this was one of my more common criticism: occasionally, a teacher would ask "what does this have to do with anything"? Typically, if an essay of mine did poorly, it was because the subjects appeared scattered. According to my teachers, this is remedied with a better thesis. Therefore, when I write now, I consider that advice before I begin. The way I find a good thesis is by observing the prompt assigned to me, putting it in the form of a question if necessary, and then coming up with a list of answers to that question. I then find evidence for each of those preliminary theses, and see which one has the strongest support. For example, in an essay on Hamlet I wrote during my senior year, my initial thesis was "\[i\]n the play 'Hamlet', many characters act as foils to the protagonist". I had not clarified why these characters are relevant, or how they speak to a main idea within the play. When I later revised the essay, my new thesis was "\[i\]n the play 'Hamlet', many characters highlight Hamlet's inaction, and speak to the theme of inaction versus action in the play". Here, I had rectified those mistakes, and now my essay had a clear idea to build support around. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Although I have improved in some areas of my writing, there are still more that I believe I can get better at. One thing I am guilty of is using more words than necessary in a paper. There are often areas in my writing that I can cut down, and use fewer words to make the same point. While I do enjoy the stylistic choices the freedom to make certain stylistic choices in writing, it is not always necessary to use more words to make a compelling point. I hope to become more skilled at using fewer words to still carry a strong argument. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jacob Mancuse =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I tend to focus on more than anything is making sure I use a wide range of vocabulary instead of using the same terms over and over again. I believe this skill is important because it shows a deeper understanding and outlook on a given topic. All throughout my academic career, my vocabulary has grown, as has most people's vocabulary. Throughout the course of high school, I began to notice that both the questions being asked and the readings I was assigned had a stronger vocabulary. I learned as I got older in the courses I took that the wider range of vocabulary I had added to my comprehension of a topic and allowed me to convey my message in a much more sophisticated manner. For example, when talking in my research paper about racial discrimination I would say, "Racial discrimination has been a prevalent issue since the dawn of the United States" rather than saying, "A big problem in the USA is racial discrimination." Having an extended vocabulary allows for a further description of your subject. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I have realized that many skills that I have learned have significantly affected my life whether that be writing or even just talking. From this point and on, I would like to work on my analyzation of readings and quotes to expand on my understanding of the topic at hand. I want my writings to seem more analytical as opposed to just repeating what I attained.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Maley ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Grace Maley ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Professor Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [10 February 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ [When I am writing one aspect that I consciously think about is making my work more interesting by replacing dull words or adjectives with more thought through and sophisticated words. When you add stronger vocab to a writing piece I believe that it engages the reader more than when the words are dull and repeated time and time again. Strong, engaging vocab was always stressed throughout my high school career in writing. My senior year teacher helped me to bulk up my papers with stronger words and vocab. Once I was showed by my teacher what a thesaurus was, I used it almost every time I was writing a paper. For one of my drafts in high school in a paper about]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ The Great Gatsby]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ I started with a very dull sentence that made my paper sound much less sophisticated than I wanted it to. I wrote in my first draft "Gatsby ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[is a rich man that keeps to himself and is the talk of the town on most days. His neighbor and soon to be friend, Nick, discovers that Gatsby loves Daisy and obsesses over her from across the bay." Once I revised this part and enhanced my vocabulary my draft improved greatly. The final draft then said "Gatsby is a wealthy and mysterious man that is the subject of much speculation. After meeting his neighbor Gatsby, Nick realizes that Gatsby longs for his one that got away that conveniently lives across the bay." By switching the wording and and changing some of the words to be less dull and more engaging my final draft was significantly better than my first draft. Although this works for me I still want to be able to work on creating a flow from one sentence to the next. I need to work less on creating engaging sentences and more on making the paper more engaging as a whole.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Riley Madden ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I really put an emphasis on thoroughly developing my thesis and making sure that my entire piece revolves around it. The thesis is the central point of the work and if you have a strong thesis then you can use the developing paragraphs of your essay to really emphasize all of the central points that need to be addressed, all reflecting back to the thesis. The significance of a developed thesis was brought to my attention by my high school AP English Literature teacher who really made an effort to show me that a thought out thesis was the key to a good essay. For example, if I was writing an essay on bears I wouldn't want my thesis to be something as vague as "bears are cool" because it does not give my essay any direction or purpose. However, if I were to say "bears are cool due to their intricate survival methods, interchangeable diets, and fascinating sleeping habits" that gives my essay a very notable purpose and also lets the reader know what my essay is going to be about within the first paragraph. While I feel very experienced with the thesis, one area I would like to become more practiced in is the argumentative pieces. I feel that when I am writing an argumentative essay in which I am trying to get someone to take my side on something, I usually end up only developing one side of the argument or not accurately addressing the other side of the argument. In order to address this area of writing, I feel as if I will need to write multiple pieces in this manner and read other more experienced authors argumentative pieces in order to fully understand how to write a well developed argumentative piece. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Peyton Mackey =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When writing a response, an argumentative essay, etc I habitually focus on my vocabulary or word choice. Utilizing a larger, more sophisticated vocabulary change an ordinary paper into an extraordinary one. Also, I feel as if my point gets across substantially better when I use a higher level vocab in order to not sound so bland. This skill is particularly important at the college, or graduate school, level however I believe it is equally important in day to day conversations. Although in high school my vocabulary was very limited, once I started reaching out of my shell and teaching myself to apply a better word choice, my writing grades improved significantly and I found myself able to hold more superior conversations, especially with those older than me. For example, in an essay I have previously written I stated "They got an interview for a job in town". This sentence is very vague, and the word choice is very monotonous, or bland. While revising this sentence I particularly looked at the words "got" and "job". I realized it isn't very time consuming or effort draining to say "They acquired an interview for a position at the pizza place in town" While upping my word selection, I also added more detail making the sentence more vivid. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One area I wish to improve on within my writing is the use of punctuation. I've got the basics, such as periods, under my belt however there is so much more entailed in the area of punctuation. For example, the use of colons, semi colons, and dashes can all be very powerful when writing if used correctly. Learning how to use some of these aspects can allow me to become a better writer by making my writing stand out and have a more powerful sense. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Word Count: 299]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Elizabeth Mackay ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my writing that I focus on is making sure the points in my essay all relate back to the main point I made in my thesis statement. It was ingrained in me by my previous instructors that the thesis statement should always precisely and accuratley portray what will be written about in the following paragraphs. Rather than make the points in my thesis statement vague, I write them with careful thought and precise words. Doing this not only allows my reader to clearly tell what my essay will be about, but also serves as a distinct outline for me and the order of my thoughts. One example of the preciseness of my thesis statements can be seen in a recent essay I wrote following an interview of my grandfather's linguistic practices. In my thesis, I distinctly outlined what I was to be writting about, including "\...He emphasized the significant role the languages he acquired in school influenced his thoughts in his travels, primarily through his trips to Canada, the loss of Gaelic as a language, and the various traditions and words used onboard a Navy vessel." These points were exactly what I included in my essay, and allowed me to direct my focus on writing about these topics specifically. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward in my writing career, I want to be able to transition between my points more smoothly, and to be able to write proper conclusions.

While this is technically the goal of a conclusion, I want to be able to more smoothly and properly be able to convey a summary of what I wrote.

This skill has gradually developed over time, but my main influence was my 11^th^ grade AP English Language and Composition teacher. He spent an entire week explaining how to properly include examples, and how to explain them relevantly. When I do write, I usually begin very vaguely, stating overall themes I would like to mention throughout the piece. After my initial draft is complete, I go back and insert ideas I have for evidence that would most likely prove my earlier views on the topic I am writing about. In an essay I once wrote for and anthropology course, my use of examples was well-timed and relevant to the piece. When describing the differences and similarities between chimpanzees and humans, I initially just explained that the human ability to think and act on those thoughts verbally and gesturally is unique to us. However, upon my second revision of this draft, I inserted a situational example explaining how a young girl might react when given the news that her mother is expecting another child but is then ridiculed when it comes to play time with the newborn. I drew similarities between the reactions of the young girl and those of a young chimpanzee in the same situation. "One can imagine the reaction a five-year-old might have when told they cannot do something they crave to do, whining and crying, perhaps even becoming increasingly violent. This is similar to the life of a chimpanzee, as Fifi displayed in the film." This skill is vital, especially when writing becomes increasingly more influential. Many of my peers tend to go off on tangents when using examples or insert them where they probably shouldn't be placed. If examples are placed in the right spot or at the right time, the reader will grow confused and the entire point that was being made will be lost. I feel that I still need to work on increasing my vocabulary. I hope to grow more sophisticated as a writer through my use of language, and I plan on using more resources such as the thesaurus and dictionary while writing. If I spend more time revising and replacing repetitive words, I believe I can develop my lexicon more than ever before. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rasheda Russell ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Rasheda Russell]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One important aspect of academic writing that I already focus on consciously as I revise my draft is making sure my body paragraph have every key component that you need to have in order for it to be a well organized well-developed paragraph.

It is important to know what was going on at that specific point in the text from where you're taking the quotation. Additionally, giving background information gives further significance to my argument and analysis that follows. It sets the base for me, and allows me to center around a specific point in the text, consequently allowing me to organize my thoughts. It lets me understand the full meaning of the quote, and better interpret what is being said. With the assistance of my high school AP Literature teacher, this is a "technique" I've gotten better at through constant peer editing and outlines provided to us. For example, in my essay regarding Hamlet, instead of simply saying "Hamlet states...." before introducing the quote, I said "Once he learned it was Ophelia in the casket, he became devastated and proclaimed his love, stating that..". It gives the quote a focus, and a context as to what was happening when it occurred. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue the semester, and the rest of my years here at Geneseo, I hope to improve on limiting my repetition. Once I repeat a few words too much, my essay becomes redundant and boring. Finding different ways to express what I'm trying to say causes my essay to be richer in vocabulary. Instead of using words I'm simply familiar with I could possibly start looking for synonyms. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Samantha Ross =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When my draft is finally fully written, I try to take my time to increase my use of imagery. I Like to be descriptive since I can add character and voice to my writing, especially when the topic I may be writing about isn't the most exciting to my readers. I personally enjoy generating different verbs and adjectives for my essays.I find that using imagery is sort of an form of art; it takes time to switch up my phrases and words to find the perfect sounding piece I feel that, in doing this, I can also help my sentences flow smoother. In one of my college essays from 2017, I voiced my resurgence from Diabetic Ketoacidosis in the summer prior. I spent a long time glaring at my sentence before the final submission. I knew something was off, and it troubled me. I wanted my intro to pack a bigger punch, and for that I needed imagery. My final intro would specifically use words that would make the admissions team squirm and cringe just as much as I did in that hospital bed, and that's the exact reaction I wanted. I needed to jump out of the paper and grab hold of the reader's attention. I started my first sentence with " *as the nurse strode away from one abused forearm to the other, clutching that large needle in her fingers" instead of my original " watch the needle in the nurses hand"*, and *"I froze completely, incredibly tense, when the IV needle tried at its third attempt at puncturing my bruised vein".* Additionally I also added, *"Funny enough, I was particularly in awe as to why all my blood was dripping down my fingers and not flowing through the IV tubes like its normally supposed to."* instead of *"waiting for the pain to start, which lasted a lifetime, and once I finally went through with the process, I was bleeding heavily".* In dramatically expanding my vocabulary in my intro paragraph, I was able to catch the reader's attention whilst attaching a voice to the story. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of writing I would like to work on is my overall grammar. Sometimes I get rather carried away with my writing and how fast I put pen to paper, that I tend to make minuscule mistakes.

During revisions, I frequently find myself cutting out large chunks of writing because it is simply a restatement of something I have already said and is weighing down the overall piece. The skill I need to work on to fix this problem is the ability to clearly articulate my point the first time it comes up so that I don\'t feel the need to re explain it every time it is referenced throughout my writing. An example of this can be seen in the twelve page paper I wrote as a senior in highschool addressing the life and works of Charles Dickens. In this essay, I described how the authors' unfortunate experiences during childhood influenced some of the most commonly recurring themes in his novels. However, later in the paper when I discussed the themes of poverty and child abuse in more detail, I found myself restating more than once what I had already explained regarding his personal experiences, simply because I felt that my earlier explanations did not sufficiently highlight the origin of Dickens' interest in such issues. The repetition began to feel like I was beating the readers over the head with my point.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of my writing that I want to develop in the future is my ability to express complicated thoughts without resorting to convoluted and unclear sentence structure. I have a tendency to let my thoughts run on in a fashion that is hard to follow on paper, and I think my writing would benefit from some thoughts being pared down and expressed in a more straightforward fashion.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gabriel Rosado ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my writing that I am consciously attentive of would have to be breaking up my paragraphs. I seem to create paragraphs of great length when I need to focus more on breaking them up based on the concepts I am explaining or introducing. It is unwise to pack too much information into paragraphs if it serves no purpose or makes the ideas being conveyed obscure. I was not aware I added too much to each paragraph until my AOP professor was forced to critique me in my INTD 170 class over last summer. For my research project, he directly stated that "the actual writing in the paragraphs \[were\] largely well done," meanwhile what I lacked was organization in the sense that all types of information were compacted into large paragraphs. He advised me to "be sure that each paragraph is a clear idea." His suggestion made me realize that while I am confident in my writing abilities, as well as my ability to convey information, I lack the structure, and possibly the precision, necessary to make my writings more adequate. It was wonderful to hear a way to improve my writing in a way that was not even aware to me. While I consciously focus on this skill now, I still need much improvement with it. I still slip up quite frequently and have to remind myself to identify the concepts that are related to each other and refine them into a cohesive paragraph that serves its own purpose under the overall goal of the assignment. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I further my education at Geneseo, I wish to continue in my endeavor of making logical, cohesive paragraphs that contain as much information necessary to answer or explain what I must. One strategy I have attempted to develop is to re-read each paragraph in isolation and inquire as to what the paragraph achieves with the information in it at the end of my works. Another strategy I have adopted is to view what concepts I portray in each paragraph and see if they are unnecessary or misplaced, so that I may correct them. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Olivia Root ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Olivia Root]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When writing, I find that what I focus on the most is the content in the essay. I try to find the best examples or arguments and focus on making those as strong as possible. I try to find a point of view that I believe others wouldn't immediately think of doing, I find when I do this, I'm more interested in what I'm writing because it wasn't necessarily something that my professor had touched upon in class. I found myself doing this when writing a paper on Hamlet. I knew lots of people would touch upon Hamlet himself so instead I chose to talk about the King. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An example from that essay is, "During the King's soliloquy there is a clear use of manipulation when he speaks. King Claudius says this to try and convince God that he is in fact upset or regretful of what he did. He questions God and the Heavens about whether or not he can actually be cleansed of what he did, almost challenging them to forgive him to prove that they are all forgiving," I found that writing about something not many people would have touched on made me more willing do do my own research and not base my paper completely on the arguments of others. I think when you can build most of your argument on your own examples and ideas and only use other's words to back up your own your essay is going to be much better. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Something I need to focus on more in the future, is making sure my thesis is clear from the very beginning of my essay. I always find myself having a watery thesis or having my thesis stated only later in my essay and having to fix it in later drafts.

It is my goal to be able to persuade the reader or further my thesis through the ability to appeal to how the said reader may react or feel about my words. More specifically the act of showing, not telling through language. This will help me as a writer reach my audience at a more intimate level, essentially giving them a bigger stake in my work. By eliciting an emotional response it is almost inevitable for an individual to care more about what is laid out in front of them. For example, this past semester I took a creative writing course in which it was required to write a narrative piece- my genre being creative non-fiction. I took the opportunity to write of a suicide attempt which transpired a few years back. After showing my professor the first draft and being workshopped by the class, I came to realize that for the story to reach its full potential, I had to put the reader directly into my shoes, to make them feel the pain and hopelessness one can feel in such a depressed state. My professor encouraged me to tap into my mind right before the attempt and how outside factors (such as my five senses) were affected by such thoughts. For that piece, I ended up detailing what I was hearing and seeing the minutes beforehand coupled with the flurry of panicked, suicidal thoughts. Adding in mundane details such as how cold the subway railing was worked to enhance the reader\'s interest in my narrative. Going into this INTD class, I hope to be able to strengthen my conclusions. Endings have always been the hardest part of writing essays for me. This can have a detrimental impact on my writing\'s overall effectiveness as the last thing the reader will hear from you is the concluding paragraph. Being able to sum up your writing into a few, concise sentences greatly benefits an author\'s ability to reach the audience. Perhaps looking at different ways to restate my thesis and summarize my argument will help me to achieve such a goal. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Bria Robinson =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Bria Robinson]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As a writer, I feel comfortable when learning skills, however, it does take me time and practice, which I don't mind because I hope to improve my writing skills every chance I can.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ One of the aspects of academic writing I focus on as I revise my drafts is, making sure my words flow coherently and make sense because no matter what topic I'm writing about I want the reader to be able to follow along. As a reader, I know getting stumped throughout a paper or book about the point trying to get across or what's happening in the book because of how it's worded is frustrating, so I always look to make sure my wording is comprehensible. Over the years, here and there by a teacher in High School or a helping family member looking over a writing piece of mine, and recently last semester a fellow student from the writing center has worked with me to fix this exact problem. A piece of advice that was the same among them was remember not to just write out every idea all at once in the paper because although the reader may have somewhat of an idea of what your trying to get across, they can get stumped along the way because they aren't sure what applies to what and where. Here's an example, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[How an anthropological concept of holism gets put in the text is included but not limited to by, how the Navajo emphasize the dire need of animal herding". Reading what is being stated in this sentence isn't unreadable, but it's poorly worded to the point that I had to reread it at least once or twice, because it was confusing, disrupting the flow of the rest of the sentence. Now if I play around with the wording a bit I get this, "How the anthropological concept of holism is applied in the text is, including but not limited to, how the Navajo emphasize animal herding". Not only did I have to read it once to understand what was being stated without getting stumped, but there are less unnecessary words. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As time goes on, I would like to get to a more comfortable level of applying grammar throughout the works of my writing, because it's something I've always felt self-conscious and unsure of. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Benjamin Robinson =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As a college student that previously majored in Environmental Studies, undertook a 4 year hiatus to work, and then returned to school as a history major; I acknowledge that I have much room to learn and improve my writing style. Through my various history courses last semester, I have learned that I need to focus on writing in a more academic sense that is succinct and to the point. I believe that developing this skill is of much importance to me in several ways. Looking back at past essays and emails that I have written, I see myself delving too far into arguments and segues that get off the path of the main argument I am trying to make. This is important for my argument to the intended reader as it elaborates points that are not necessary and burdens my reader with unnecessary reading. This is important for me as a student as I take unnecessary time out of my own busy schedule to write and scrutinize sections of my essays and emails that are unnecessary. For example, when I started my first semester at Geneseo; I undertook Professor Lewis' class on Apartheid. Professor Lewis would assign 500 word essays and I would respond with writing 800-1000 word essays. I would go off on unnecessary tangents in my papers covering one argument extensively and then neglecting my arguments at the end of the paper to try and accommodate the expected length. Unfortunately posting an example of this will put this response above the suggested word count (exactly what I am referring to), however I find it necessary to include this. This paragraph comes from a essay response with a suggested length of 500 words: "The "Land Question" in South Africa stems from the segregationist land policy known as The Native Lands Act of 1913, and the question of how to undo the damage that it, paired with Apartheid policies; inflicted on the non-white South African population. The question also considers the matter of making reparations to the displaced and oppressed non-white Native South African population by means of land redistribution. The Natives Land Act paired with the Group Areas Act of 1950 separated not just black from white, but also separated Native South Africans into tribes and prescribed separate "homelands" creating an effective instrument of segregation that compelled Native South Africans to stay divided among themselves instead of uniting in a common cause against their oppressors. The Land Question left a lasting legacy of segregation and hardship, it also left many Native South Africans divided among themselves. The legacy of the Land Question, and its failure to administer land redistribution and right the wrongs of the Native Lands Act continues to this day." This excerpt is an introduction and it exemplifies my need for improvement in writing academic essays. I could have shortened this significantly, fleshed out the specific arguments in the introduction for the following paragraphs. I improved this skill later on, but based on the length of this response already, there is room for improvement. Professor Lewis pointed out to me that while my writing was good, I needed to learn to condense my writing. I take this criticism to improve myself, I want to learn to be a better writer and I am excited about the prospect of learning to improve myself as that is why I am attending college in the first place. By the end of my first semester I was writing essays faster and in a more concise way, considerably reducing my belated word count; I still see the need for improvement however. I look forward to hearing your criticism and suggestions for improving my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Michael Roach =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on making my arguments clear in the introduction because that way I can easily transition into my body paragraphs and not just make that the essay I\'m writing just a jumbled mess of words with no substance behind them. If no arguments are provided, then there isn\'t much point behind writing an essay, and to whatever person may be reading it, They will have no clue what point I\'m trying to convey to them. This was something in high school that both my English and History teachers worked very heavily with me with, in order to better prepare me for the regents and IB exams. I think a good example of this is actually the most recent email I have written, where I immediately Jump into my argument why I can\'t show up to my shift, in which I wrote \"My family is planing to celebrate my birthday the weekend of the 22nd and I won't be in town, Son would anyone be willing to cover for me while I\'m gone?\" The argument here is that I cannot show up to my shift because of my birthday celebration. Which to then of course I provide evidence after: \"We have planned this for a while and a lot of relatives I don\'t see a lot will be attending.\" I provide reasons as to why It would mean a lot to me if someone covered my shift. However, in my essays, I don\'t use enough sources. I feel like I only use one or two sources from the same author. Going forward I would like to incorporate more sources in my essays, like four or five sources, instead of one. Perhaps going forward I can make use of Milne library to find more sources I can incorporate into my essays.

Some of what I'm writing does what the task asks to do, but I always make sure that I follow what I want more in the writing instead of all my focus being on what I think will impress the person who's grading my assignment. For example, I had this sentence "And because globalization is so fast it more or less is in real time" and I thought about changing it to "Globalization goes at a pace that is in real time" ,but I felt like that is not something that I would say myself without pressure to say things that I don't.

It's been drilled into me as a younger age with the formats and the need to make your claim believable. I feel like I give a lot of explanation but being concise and deliberate with what I include is important. In a way, my sentence structure may reflect how I naturally speak in a superfluous manner despite having a more appropriate tonality in my writing. For a sociology example had this apart of my explanation of gender roles and stereotypes in Avatar the Last Airbender :]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Firstly Sokka a young warrior, wanted to embody the chivalrous guy archetype while he's left in the village by his father and all the other older men to fight in the war against an imperialist nation.

In addition, I need to remember to not use passive voice in my writing which has been pointed out to be for years by an old writing tutor. Without a passive voice, I can add more impact to what I write. For example, "After being instructed by his father to protect....he stressed to embody this idea of warrior strength. He 'trained' and was protective of all the others in the village but also adapted an inflated concept on his own role of being the only man in the village, despite only being 16.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I grow in the future, I hope to be able to identify what information is most effective to use and also make sure my structure of sentences doesn't weaken what I have to say or confuse the audience.

A lot of the times when I'm writing I'll have an idea about what I want to discuss later in the piece, that I rush to finish my first idea, so I don't forget what I want to say later. This became a problem because I'd have a piece that was full of rushed and unfulfilled topics. My English teacher recognized this pattern and gave me some tips to change the habit. He told me that I should always keep an extra piece of paper next to me so that when a thought strikes, I can pause and write down the idea and then save it for when it fits into the paper, so I won't forget it. It's a small piece of advice but it's really helped my writing because it gives me the chance to finish my thoughts and turn in work that feels complete. An example of this would be, when I was writing a report of an interview I did with my grandfather. Instead of skipping over the chance to add more detail to an idea and saying, "My grandfather and his mother were very close. They spent a lot of time together as a family, especially at holidays," I would tell a story about how close they were, like "My grandfather and his mother were very close. She used to drop him off for kindergarten and pick him up after and he used to freak out if she wasn't there on time," in order to really finish the idea. It's not exactly a breakthrough idea, pre-planning your work, but it's something that really helped me improve my writing. I'm really hoping to improve on the smaller details. I believe that I have a good base to my writing and I'm able to create good thoughts, but I want to be better at picking out the smaller problems. Details such as knowing when a sentence is going too long, when a sentence is not necessary, and just small things that can really send my writing over the edge. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jose Romero ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my academic writing that I consciously focus on is unpacking textual evidence from a passage, paper, and/or literary text to illustrate and support my claims. This skill, taught to me by Dr. Beth McCoy, is one I did not know was essential in writing. It very important that I analyze a quote from a text since it needs to enhance the overall theme/argument/claim that I am trying to convey throughout an essay. Unpacking textual evidence is a skill that also requires deep analysis, and increases a reader's metacognition about what they are reading. When I learned this skill in English 101, I struggled at first since I thought I knew why the quote was important to include in my essay but I did not know if was a meaningful contribution to the general arc of my writing. However, I slowly developed my own template in analyzing textual evidence by asking myself, "does this support my paragraph\'s intention? Does it support the general claims of this essay? Would this quote provoke further literary analysis and thoughtful conversation?" By asking these questions, I have been able to feel confident about my ability to critically think about text. Since then, I have been able to shape my writing from, "On page 11, we were introduced to the cataclysm that occurred in the Tirimo. It states, "At the northernmost end of this valley is devastation: shattered trees, tumbled rock faces, a hanging pall of dust that has not dissipated in the still, sulfur-tinged air. Where the initial shock wave hit, nothing remains standing: it was the sort of shake that jolts everything to pieces and rattles those pieces into pebbles" (Jemisin 11). This piece of text alludes to the many disasters that the stillness brings" to: "\...Though this piece of text was hard to dissect at the beginning due to the relevance of its context to the narrative of Essun, Jemisin's introductory example of geology alludes to the many future upcoming catastrophic events seen throughout the book." ]{style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;"} [Moving forward, I would like to continue developing my ability to draft and practice editing. Most often that not, I complete an assignment a day or two before it is due and I barely have any time left over to revise it. I would like to focus on slowing down, unpack my thinking and ideas, and build my own system for editing my pieces of work. I believe my current courses, English 203 and INTD 105 will be places where I can practice and work on achieving my writing goals. ]{style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kevin Ries ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write, I really focus in on my supporting evidence in argumentative papers. I try to gain as much concrete and relevant evidence that supports my thesis statement. I'll also gather evidence for the opposite side as well. If I can understand and gain some evidence for an opposing viewpoint, I have found that I am better able to counter those arguments. When I was first experimenting with adding more evidence for the opposite side, then creating counterarguments for them, the main critique from my twelfth grade English teacher was that I put too much evidence for the opposite side which ended up hurting my thesis. Over the course of the year, I continued to find a better balance between the two. On our final research paper of the year, I talked about police brutality and its impact on our country in recent years. I was praised by my teacher for having an excellent balance between my supporting, concrete evidence and, the evidence I gathered that supported the opposite side. Along with that, my ability to write strong counterarguments to the opposite side's evidence greatly increased. Now, gathering evidence and writing strong counterarguments has been a major focus and has greatly improved the quality of my essays. While attending Geneseo, I hope to improve on taking more time to proofread and rewrite my papers. In the past, I would procrastinate and leave the paper for the last minute. One strategy I've learned and started to utilize here is to write the first paper a few days early, then, proofread and rewrite it after I clear my head. It gives me a fresh look at my papers and helps me better proofread and edit them. Already, I've seen the quality of my papers improve. However, I still need to work on giving myself even more time to rewrite them so I can get the best grade possible.

Most of my skills and knowledge about writing parts of an essay efficiently, for example the intro paragraph, originates from history courses I have taken here at Geneseo through the advice and guidance of my professors. One aspect that I have learned is to make sure the intro paragraph lets the audience know what material and or concepts, the paper will be using to properly and efficiently convey a certain topic. An intro paragraph from before I began doing this would read "Many people consider the start of World War I to be a simple spark that lit off the powder keg and that Europe unintentionally began the conflict, while others say that Europe "sleepwalked" into the war. I believe that European empires intentionally walked into the conflict over a long period of time but sleepwalked into the consequences. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was not a spark as much as it was simply the straw that broke the camel's back." With this new strategy I added the sentence "The four main components that led to the war are imperialism, militarism, and revolution." From this intro I was able to show what the topic of the essay would be, "I believe that European empires intentionally walked into the conflict over a long period of time but sleepwalked into the consequences." Showing that the topic was World War 1 and the discussion was the cause of the conflict. The intro also shows what concepts the paper would use through its arguments "The four main components that led to the war are imperialism, militarism, and revolution." This lets the audience know that these four concepts will appear in the essay, most likely in the order they were listed. One issue I hope to overcome while moving forward is being able to properly convey an essay geared for arguing a topic. While writing I find it difficult to differentiate between arguing a position and discussing a topic. This leads to my argument essays not having a strong stand on the assigned or chosen issue, making it seem more like a discussion. I could develop better techniques for arguments if I try being a little more subjective writing style. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Madelyn Rice ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One thing I tend to focus on in my writing is substance. I make a conscious effort to give value to all of my sentences to the extent where an essay would seem incomplete if missing one. Fluff is obviously not good for papers, from a grading standpoint, but people also tend to gloss over the fact that it disengages the reader from a piece. No audience will be genuinely interested in a paper if the last paragraph they read was all unneeded details and restated information from the previous. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of the aspects in writing that I need to workshop is my attention to structure. I have a tendency to pump out a lot of important information with no coherency. (This is commonly known as a "Brain Dump".) This is because the way I naturally write is stream of consciousness. I tend to go off on tangents and completely lose sight of my direction with an argument. In one of the final essays I wrote senior year, I discussed the idea of a "Quarter-Life Crisis". The topics I explored were very fluid and only vaguely related to one another- fitting loosely under the umbrella of the idea of crisis. My paper starts with topics like "lately I have been pushing myself to get out more and live my life, to reconnect with people, to live my life before it is over" then transitions to an excerpt from my personal journal about a boy I had liked. Later in the essay it goes on to talk about elements of psychology founded by Erik Erikson and then transitions to how the individual would define their own personal sense of identity. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When I go about writing with the main intention of making a well crafted and structured argument, I can usually do the job well ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[enough]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, but it requires extensive foresight and planning. My main goal over the course of this class is to get into the habit of planning ahead and thinking critically about the essay writing and editing process. No essay is ever done on the first try.

It is important to make sure the thesis and introductory sentence makes sense and clearly states what you are arguing. I have gotten many feedbacks from previous teachers and professors who do encourage me to be more expressive and detailed about what I will ultimately write in my body paragraphs because you want the reader to be intrigued just by reading the first couple of sentences. One example is when one of my sentences was written as, "There are many reasons as to why humans are causing global warming." I of course revised it to, "Burning fossil fuels, littering, and overusing electricity are some examples of why humans are causing global warming." One aspect I want to develop effectively for the future is to just be less vague with my writing. It is important that any writer utilizes sources to help them with their argument but not to the point where we just copy and paste what those sources provide. I want to be able to be expressive with my own words and show readers the originality but fluidity of my papers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Elizabeth Reynolds ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I particularly focus on when writing essays has to do with the quality of my quotes and sources that I get outside information from. I am confident in my ability to find scholarly sources, locate crucial information, and then connect said information to the point I am trying to make with my primary source. When I was in high school I had to write an essay surrounding the identity development of the monster Grendel in John Gardner's *Grendel*. The book itself is a retelling of the old legend of Beowulf but from the monster's perspective. My essay discussed how and why Grendel was who he was, why he attacked villagers but pitied them at the same time, why he went back and forth in terms of who he wanted to become. The main point was that it was because of his interactions with others growing up and the lack of emotional connection or support between them that he developed such a distorted sense of identity. After including key quotes from the book that helped support my argument, I included some information I had found regarding scientific research on the development of self-image and identity in the minds of teenagers (the relative age of Grendel at the time). One sentence I wrote in my essay was, "His personal philosophies, thoughts, emotions, and motives constantly change as his concept of self is so unbalanced and insecure." Then I supported my quote with words from a scientist by the name of Kendra Cherry saying, "Without any encouragement or support, an individual will "remain insecure and confused about themselves and the future," and that insecurity will make the individual feel that they are "...not sure of who they are or what they like...Instead of feeling a sense of personal cohesiveness, they are left feeling disappointed and confused about their place in life.'" I was able to support my analysis of a fictional character with non-fictional knowledge, and my teacher commended me for my ability to do so on my own. With the help of INTD 105 & 106 I hope to improve my skills in summarizing. I have a tendency to over-summarize in essays unnecessarily, and it takes up valuable time and space where I could be further developing my theme or analysis. I always feel the need to describe the context or history behind a character or story and I think that I usually take it beyond where it needs to be. So for the next couple of weeks I hope to be more cautious of such tendencies and improve my overall writing ability. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Meghan Reitz ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing I already focus on is structure and word use. I am very good at setting up organized essays and paragraphs and I am able to allow a nice flow to my sentences from choosing effective words. My English teachers taught me the generic five paragraph essay format that I use to structure almost any essay I write. I start out with a short, but concise introduction, that gives just enough detail to engage the reader and then I start the body paragraphs packed with evidence that is explained to fit my argument. Once I form a rough draft, I typically will print it out and read it over and make changes. I then will give a copy to a friend or someone at the writing center and have them also read it over. I make the necessary changes needed and read it over again to make sure everything is perfect. One of my last essays that I wrote was about the book "Fahrenheit 451." Before I even started writing I bulleted all the points that I wanted to make throughout the essay to support my claim. From my bullet points I was able to generate a thought provoking and concise thesis. I added some information in my introduction but mostly vague information to save all my thoughts for the main body paragraphs. After my introduction was complete, I went on to the main body paragraphs where I stated my bullet points and went on to thoroughly explain them. For example, I wouldn't just say "Clarisse's death impacted Montag greatly." Instead I would elaborate and say, "After Clarisse died, Montag's perspective of the world he lived in drastically changed. He was no longer happy in the utopia he lived in." The second sentence provides a deeper analysis of the book and a better perspective at the underlying themes and the message the book is trying to portray to the reader. As a writer, I would like to learn how to form better sentences and write effectively faster. I find myself taking days to write a paper that should only take an hour because I can't seem to perfect it. If I was able to learn how to write a good paper and not spend days trying to perfect it, my writing for Geneseo would greatly improve. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Theresa Reinesch ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I consciously focus on while producing a paper or during a revision period is "pushing beyond the text" as my previous years teacher would constantly say. The difference between a satisfactory paper and a well written one is making outside connections to examples or quotes already stated in a paper and promoting additional thoughts or ideas. Instead of simply creating a topic sentence, quoting an example and explaining how it relates back to the topic sentence, there are more questions you should ask yourself; why is this important? How does this affect me, my peers, my school, the world? Are there more underlying issues that this topic brings up? What should society as a whole do in response to this? More outside thought and connections adds depth and additional insight, creating a stronger argument or further proving the point of one\'s work. For example, in a past paper I used the topic sentence, "In Hershey\'s text, the media portrays disabled individuals as pathetic and helpless". Instead of providing a textual example of when this has occurred in the media and explaining how it displays disabled individuals as impotent, one should additionally add and further discuss how "It is important for individuals as a whole who visit these media sites to stand up and change society\'s botched view on normality". It is important to push beyond the text because it will ensure a more effective paper and will get readers to fully believe and understand the points addressed. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While writing at Geneseo, I am going to strive to eliminate my use of run on sentences. This is something I have struggled with in the past. As I write a sentence, I have too much thought about one aspect running through my mind at once so I tend to write it all out before I forget. I later go back and reread these sentences and am able to revise the error, but I want to concentrate on organizing my thoughts from the beginning and not have to rely so much on going back to fix my run on sentences each and every time. I could create an outline prior to writing an essay to organize my thoughts in the future. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mary Reid ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I tend to use evidence from outside sources very well. I like to do thorough research and make sure that my writing is backed up by outside evidence. I feel as though information from reputable sources is very important to establishing credibility as a writer. The sources I tend to use are reputable and informative, and help prove my points. In a paper I wrote about GMOs in the European Union, I wrote, "In a statement published on their website, the European Green Party argue that they need to see 'increasing public awareness, personal engagement and participative democracy in determining and improving food policies throughout Europe' (*European Greens *2015)." I try to cite sources that have been written in the last five years or so to keep my information as current and accurate as possible. However, I also believe that I rely too heavily on the work of others. One aspect of writing that I tend to struggle with is including my own thoughts instead of simply summing up the beliefs of other authors in the future. I find that I tend to describe the research that other people have done more often than I add my beliefs on the matter. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Luke Reid ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In revising my academic writing, I tend to focus the most on making my sentences flow together in a way that makes sense and sounds coherent. I do this because, in writing my initial draft of the piece, I may be too eager to just get my points down and generate an overall vision for the paper. This can easily lead to sentences looking disjointed next to each other, with no clear connection between what I say in one sentence and what I say in the next. To fix this, I try to see where I can include transitional words and phrases. If I don't have transitional word or phrase I can use, either because I can't think of one that fits or I've exhausted my use of others, I will usually consult the internet to find one that works. For instance, I may revise a sequence of disjointed sentences, such as, "A great deal of the pieces we've covered from early China promote standards and values that would seem almost impossible to follow. There is very probable correlation between what writings survived the tides of time and what writings the ruler would have wanted to survive," to changing the beginning of the second sentence to, "Moreover, there is a very probable correlation..." The two sentences in this example are points I make to support the argument I'm making about Chinese ideology, but without the transitional phrase, it is unclear that these are two separate points I am making, and that my point in the second sentence isn't a conclusion I'm making about my point in the first sentence.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my writing at Geneseo and beyond, I would like to develop my ability to structure a paper. I still feel very limited by the general five-paragraph structure that high school drilled into me, and I would like to learn how to break away from it while still having a clear and understandable structure. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Payton Reese ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on creating a piece of writing that flows smoothly from one topic to another as concisely as possible. In a recent essay I changed the sentence "Throughout the show, when Piper would try to change things she would receive push back whether it be from the faculty in the facility or from people she knew on the outside" to "Throughout the show, when Piper would try to change things she would receive push back when others decided that she had done too much". Although the change is subtle, the reduction in length in sentences like this one throughout the essay made a big difference. When I consciously write more concisely, my argument is easier to understand and the attention of the reader is maintained more effectively. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future I would like to create thesis statements that effectively introduce my essay by giving the reader a clear image of what my essay is about. In the past I have had trouble creating a thesis statement that encompasses all of the key aspects of the composition in a way that is compact and intriguing. During high school my essays would be effective in the body portion but my teachers suggested that I put more work into creating strong thesis statements. A strong thesis statement will set the tone for an essay and is the foundation on which the rest of the essay is constructed upon. This key part of an essay also helps to generate interest in the topic if done properly. If the reader is intrigued, they will pay more attention to what you have written throughout the rest of your essay.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emma Reed ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Emma Reed]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106-01]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection 1 ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As a writer, I focus on various things when developing a piece. When I am writing, I try to develop strong arguments for what I am writing about. I believe that it is important to develop a strong thesis that you can back up with detail and evidence that can be used to further prove your point. I work to create a piece that not only is developed but can also prove a point. In my high school writing class, our teacher focused on the importance of argument-based essays. We spent time on multiple argumentative essays. My teacher showed me ways to strengthen my thesis, and how I can write in a way that makes the reader listen. I was taught how to develop an argument that is backed by sufficient evidence. An example of writing without evidence could be, "Zora Neale Hurston is always reminded that she is colored". An example of supporting this with sufficient evidence is, "Zora Neale Hurston was constantly reminded that she was colored, "Someone is always at my elbow reminding me that I am the grand-daughter of slaves (115)".

I have taken many social science courses and my papers usually include statistics and research information where I have to be aware of biases. For example in a paper I wrote "This statistic proves that it is vital as a society that we normalize discussions on rape and rape culture." Generally I should avoid using phrases like "prove" or "proof" when referencing a study because according to APA a study cannot prove a theory but only support it. I should have wrote "This statistic aids the idea that it is vital as a society that we normalize discussions on rape and rape culture."]{style="font-size: 1rem;"} [ From now on I will continue to make a conscious effort to avoid biases when writing papers and using correct formatting in general.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sarah Ramsaroop ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing an essay, I focus mostly on connecting my statements to the bigger picture of why I am writing about this topic. I always make sure that my paragraphs connect back to the main idea and thesis I've made in my introduction. I developed this skill during my junior year of my high school when my AP English teacher brought the issue to my attention because of all the essays we wrote. It was very common for me to not connect my body paragraphs back to my thesis and showing the correlation. For example, I would have a paragraph with information such as, "The body is made up many cells and atoms" and never have an ending sentence going back to the main idea of the paper. After, my English class I learnt how to go back to my thesis reminding the audience of the papers purpose. So, my paragraphs now it is a habit to connect my details to my thesis, "The body is made up of many cells and atoms. Therefore, showing the human body is complex and made up of more than one particle." I would like to say that I have learnt and became better at connecting my ideas back to the purpose of the essay. One of my weaker skills is using proper grammar and punctuation and going forward I hope INTD 106 can help me solve these issues. When writing paper's, I either put to many commas in places they do not belong, or I will not put a comma where it needs to be placed. When I ask others to read my papers, I make it a habit to ask them to check my grammar and punctuation because I'm not very good at it. Also, having good punctuation and grammar is usually an important criterion for papers and hold a weight to the overall grade of the paper. This issue is something I hope to become better at and understand for future papers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ismaela Ramanu ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When working on academic writing, I prioritize the topic and purpose of my subject. I think the most important aspect of any academic writing is definitely the message it is trying to convey, so I do my best to package the topic and purpose of my writing in a way that is not only easily understood by my audience but also in a way that piques the interest of the readers. I think so because of the writings I have read, I found writings with clear topics and purpose easier to comprehend and more enjoyable reads. Hence, for instance in my piece of writing about how I incorporate sustainable practices in my everyday life and why I do, I used the phrase "It is now occurring to me that I may want to incorporate green in my everyday life; however, though disappointing, I have not been an actor, consciously or by default, in protecting the environment I live in" early in the introduction to make readers aware of the topic of my writing and also in an unexpected way that it surprises my readers since I begin my essay by expressing the importance of practicing sustainable practices but end the introduction with a statement that I have not to practiced what I preach nonetheless. This gives a general yet insufficient knowledge to the readers and causes them to want to read more. What I would like to add to my writing is some style because I feel sometimes my writings sound generic and my voice is not heard in my work. So, I intend to read on making my voice heard in my writings and developing a style that will make my writings more beautiful, and have some form of signature. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: John Ragozzino ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One key element of writing that I focus on is using vocabulary words that really emphasize the ideas that I am writing about. This is an important skill because it shows the reader that the writing is very knowledgeable on the topic that they are talking about, as well as making the actual piece of writing more interesting. I\'ve always tried to expand on my vocabulary, from a young age, however while studying for the SAT and ACT exams, I noticed that my vocabulary was greatly improved. In addition, one of my high school English teachers was a big reason for the improvement of my writing. For instance, in one of my essays from last semester, I changed the word \"however\" to \"nevertheless\". This is just one example of how I try to use more sophisticated vocabulary in my writing. In the future, I would like to work on my sentence structure. In particular, my main goal is to compose longer and more in-depth sentences that I currently do. Once I work on this, I think that my writing pieces will seem more intriguing and really capture the readers attention more. Furthermore, this will allow me to develop more complex ideas in my writing and fit more information in my writing as well. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Lumbis ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [While revising my drafts, I look for sentences that lack flow or do not make sense. I think this is very important because when mistakes are made, it can be difficult for the reader to understand the writing, and it disrupts the flow of the rest of the text. I have received feedback from high school English teachers about this in the past, so I am always sure to look for it when I am revising my writing. For example, I initially opened a paragraph with the statement "Hamlet spent much of the play procrastinating making it a major theme in the text." This is not a very strong introduction to the paragraph, and it does not have good flow. While revising this, I noticed that the sentence did not really make sense or flow well, so I changed it to "Hamlet spent much of the play procrastinating, which makes it a major theme in the text."

I often get so caught up in the moment when I am writing that, while I feel like I am making a strong logical argument, I do not take enough time to fully elaborate on the point I am trying to make. I know that I need to get better at this skill as it is important while writing to be able to coherently and concisely get across your ideas to your reader. In my INTD-105 class while working with a fellow classmate revising each other's writing for an in-class assignment, she pointed out to me that I had failed to portray an argument we were supposed to be making out of another authors writing, as to what that author was implying. I had written that "In Girls to the Front, Sara Marcus discusses Ian MacKayes pandering towards the Riot Grrrl movement, and his inability to grasp the intentions of the group while acting as if he did". She pointed out that the word 'discusses' does not necessarily imply Marcus's feelings, which is what we were supposed to be extracting and elaborating upon. As a writer I feel that learning how to be more concise will help me greatly as I continue to complete more academic assignments. I will continue to be mindful as I write and revise my work in the future as to hone this skill to the best of my ability. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jada Lucarelli ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As it is hard to pick just one useful writing tip I have been given, since there has been so many, one that does stick out to me comes from one of my TA's in a communications class last semester. My writing tended to be too descriptive without explanation and she taught me how to adapt on each sentence to improve my writing. For example a sentence from a first draft in one of my essays states "The effect that mass media of television programs has had on my cousin Mike is extremely inspiring". Using the tips from my TA I was able to adapt on this sentence and explain why it is important. In my final draft I revised this sentence into "The effect that mass media of television programs have had on my cousin Mike Nulton is not only inspiring, but also rare due the level of success he has now accomplished.

When revising drafts, I mainly focus on the development of my sentences. More specifically, the flow and completeness of the sentences throughout the writing assignment as a whole. Sentences are what make up paragraphs and essays. If sentences do not flow together and are all jumbled up all on top of each other it would be hard for readers to read. The coherence of sentences could be better by using transition words. A lot of the times when I write paragraphs or essays, my sentences do not seem like they are in a good flow and I usually only use transition words when transitioning to different paragraphs. Some transition words that would be good to use when revising one of my works to make paragraphs more closely connected could be consequently, for example, therefore, and instead. One of my teachers from a different college taught me that when writing for assignments, you plan your writing and then build off from that prewriting and then correct that to the final paper. Planning and brainstorming for your writing assessment makes your assignment a whole lot easier because you then have something to reference off. For example, if I was revising a paper for a History class, I would include some transitions words between paragraphs and make the sentences flow all together. A sample sentence might be, However, the Industrial Revolution was an important event in world history. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [There are many aspects that I would want to have developed to have effected writing at Geneseo but, the main one would be backing up my claim through more encouraged details.

I try to give each sentence a purpose and be sure that it's not too lengthy; or too short. This skill is important because it can either draw in the reader or confuse them with sudden pauses. I first started paying attention to this detail when I saw a Tumblr post about the importance of the length of sentences. Some sentences are extremely long to the point where it is ridiculous and simply carry on meaninglessly which causes the essay to be too boring. Some are too short. It is important to write the right length at the right times to make my writing flow smoothly. After reading the Tumblr post, I started to notice this skill in the books that I read. I decided to master this and make it my own. One example of my improvement is that I used to write sentences like "The sky was blue. It was a warm day. I walked outside for a moment and saw that the sun was shining bright and clear. I did not notice that the squirrels have taken shelter away from the sun and even the grasshoppers were crowding in the shade from the heat.". These sentences are long, excessive, and I found a way to improve them. Now I would write "It was a particularly warm day in Geneseo, New York. I stepped out for a moment and was immediately feeling the burning heat wave. I should've noticed that the squirrels stopped climbing trees and were burrowing holes to hide in; even the crickets have hopped away to find better shade." I am a good writer, but I know that I have a lot more to improve. I wish to learn more skills that can aid my writing and maybe even teach others how to write skillfully. In Geneseo, I would concentrate on writing more concisely and using more complex vocabulary. There are ways to sound more professional and interesting, and I would like to learn those skills. I believe that I can do this by reading more books and try to implement more fascinating language into my essays. Overall, I believe that my time in Geneseo will be beneficial to my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ashley Lewis ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I am confident in my abilities to go from writing statements that just point out facts or statistics to presenting those facts in a persuasive manner. I especially, focus on this in a conclusion because that is the last chance you have to persuade our audience. If you end your essay or any piece of writing with a weak conclusion it can leave a bad taste in the readers mouth, even if your body paragraphs were strong. One of techniques that has helped my write stronger conclusions was a "call to action". This can be a very effective technique when done properly and depending on the subject of your paper. After you've convinced your reader that the problem you are discussing is an actual problem then you give them a solution or possible way to help. An example would be an initially boring conclusion where you are just restating the introduction such as "Climate change is a serious problem because it will affect generations to come." or "In conclusion, every country should pitch into helping stop global warming before it's too late".

I would say I have a strong understanding of what it takes to hook the reader before I start an essay and use rhetoric's to intrigue the reader. My high school English teacher used to make the class pick an argumentative topic for a warm-up and write a short introduction using ethos, pathos and logos. I truly feel that if you provide a strong background at the start of your writing, use rhetorical appeals or even start the writing off with a rhetorical question, it orients the reader's attention and makes the overall piece more interesting. For example, if I were talking about an essay topic that debates whether animals should be used for research, I would start my essay with a phrase like, "Animals are similar to the human being; with hearts that beat just like your own" or "Why do animals need to be the backbone of deciding whether or not a certain product should be placed on the market"? I would use the rhetorical appeal pathos and appeal to the readers emotions from the start.\ As time progresses, I am always interested in learning how to expand information from multiple sources throughout my paragraphs. I find myself constantly trying to condense quoted material from different sources into one or two long sentences that does not make total sense or jumps back and forth between ideas. Hopefully, I will develop a skill that allows me to take information and spread it out evenly though my paper, rather than having a bunch of random points and ideas all in one paragraph. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Claire Lenihan ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Claire Lenihan 2/6/19\ INTD 106\ Self-Reflection \#1 Throughout high school I wrote a countless amount of papers. Many of the classes I took focused heavily on writing, with teachers that really emphasized its importance. Junior and senior year I took AP Language and Composition as well as AP Literature. Although the classes were challenging, I found them useful in improving the overall quality of my writing. One of the techniques I try to pay extra attention to when composing an essay is making my writing flow nicely, specifically, when I am inserting a quote into my work. Previously, I would use phrases like: "In the novel The I've Got the Light of Freedom, Charles Payne says: "SNCC is so different from the better-known civil rights organizations that it is easy to see it as a sharp break with the past." To avoid sounding choppy in my writing I focus now on using signal phrases like "According to Payne," or "In his novel, Payne asserts that..." and following it up by a direct quote. In doing this I find that my essays and papers sound better and are easier for the audience to read.\ Moving forward, I would like to improve my use of punctuation in my writing. I feel as though I am constantly using commas even where they do not belong. I am not fully comfortable in knowing when and where certain punctuations marks like colons, semicolons, dash's, etc. go in a sentence. After taking this course I hope to increase my use of correct punctuation, in hopes of forming pieces of writing without structural problems. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Terry Lei ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my opinion, the introduction is the most important part of any piece of writing. It is the part that readers see first, and depending on the writing it will first introduce all the ideas that will be present in the rest of the writing to us with context and the main idea. I focus on making an outline[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}for the introduction first, and disregard outlining the body paragraphs[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}because I will have some idea of it after I complete my introduction. For example, in my music class I had to write about[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}an opera and its social relations; I first make up a thesis on what I should base my entire essay on. The thesis I had come up with was: This intermezzo is poking fun at the disparity of the social classes, by having the roles of Uberto and Serpina seemingly switched, which can be interpreted by the audience differently depending on where they stand in society depending on their rank on the social ladder. I then noted down context about the opera and the time period, and put it all together once my introduction outline was complete. This allows for my ideas to flow easier; I try to focus a lot on organization in academic writing. One aspect that I would like to develop effectively is to provide ample details and evidence that actually support my thesis and topic sentences. Sometimes, I write a topic sentence but cannot find much evidence to support it. Instead of scrapping the whole idea, I write a few sentences about it without actual proof, such as quotes, and move on to the next topic instead. I know that this makes my argument less valid, so it is definitely something I have to work on, whether it be to get rid of the idea or to be able to find evidence more efficiently. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ryan Lee ====================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Ryan Lee\ 01/07/19\ INTD 106 assignment one\ Gillian Paku As I progress through my education, I have noticed that I tend to focus on the elevation of words, making them more complex and sound more educated. I picked this tendency up at an early age due to the fact that an elevated vocabulary displays knowledge and a higher level of thinking. While I go through my essays, checking over my work, I often look for words that I repeat often, or words that make my writing appear juvenile. An example of this elevation of word choice in my last essay was when I said, "\... I have been able to see the differences in phonology more easily than others." by replacing the word "accents" with "phonology" I was able to make my essay seem less repetitive and more sophisticated.\ Throughout my writing experiences in school, I have noticed that I have a major weakness when it comes to organization. Although I can create well-rounded sentence, I often have trouble keeping my ideas organized, going off on tangents as I consider different points of view and arguments. I want to work on my organization skills because regardless of the content of an essay, without a comprehensible framework, the essay begins to sound uninformed. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Lawrence ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write, whether it be an essay for my English class or for my history class, I tend to focus on my supporting details that help me prove my point. In other words, I try to pay attention to how much detail I put into my work, which specific details I use, and when I use them. When I was still getting used to the idea of supporting a claim I make about specific works or ideas, it was difficult for me to write in such detail. Many of my teachers even told me that I was too vague or that I kept everything too broad. Eventually though, I got the knack for writing in detail. Take for example, my short journal entry from an English class I took in high school, when I talked about how much I loved my kitchen table; "I am currently sitting in my spot, facing the sliding doors, which usually show my backyard, but as of right now reflect me doing my homework." Although now I am able to write in detail, I sometimes still don't write enough or worse, I write slightly too much. When I first was told that I didn't have enough details, I once wrote almost two paragraphs of only quotes from the novel I was reading in class. Another problem I have is that after the details or quotes I use, I sometimes don't elaborate on why I used them as a detail. This is probably my biggest problem since numerous teachers have pointed this out to me. I think the main reason I do this is because I know why I'm using it and in my own head, everyone would know why I used it. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexa LaRocca =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Self Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Alexa LaRocca]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would like to consider myself a pretty good writer simply due to the fact that in high school and last semester, I received high grades on all of my papers. With that being said, I know I certainly can improve on a few skills, such as my time management, effective use of language to create focus, and overall paper length. A skill I think I am proficient at is my use of language and stringing of words. With this skill I am able to create interest in the subject I am discussing and accurately describe my ideas. For example I wrote, "Playing a key role in democracy, media serves as the voice for the people, revealing and exposing all injustice in our world, and bringing light to those most important issues, but today, media seems to serve a different role." With this stringing of words I was able to get all my major points out in one sentence so they could set the tone for the rest of the paper.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my writing previously, my teachers in high school told me that I often write with too much "fluff" rather than getting straight to the point.

This often causes me to go beyond the page limit for the paper. I recognize this is a problem of mine, so in order to improve I think I need to do a better job with the writing process as a whole. I am a big procrastinator, so I often write my papers the day before they are due, because of this that leaves little time for me to plan or rework my paper. I typically write it all in one sitting. Through taking INTD 105 and 106, I hope to break these procrastinator tendencies and plan out my work well before the deadline, reworking multiple drafts so I can use my words most effectively, getting straight to the point rather than rambling on. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Honestly I know I have these bad habits but it is so much easier to be lazy and stick to them rather than working hard to break the cycle.

Imagery is a simple technique that is taught from an early age, but I truly believe it has contributed in large part to the success of my writings in high school. By remembering this when writing essays, I am able to not only give the reader an advanced understanding of what I am trying to say, but I also give a sense of depth to the work and a perspective that is uniquely my own. I wrote two papers in high school which I feel qualify as good examples for my use of imagery. The first was my Junior Research Paper (JRP), and the second I titled 'Limitless'. I discussed cultural change in my JRP, while 'Limitless' was about what I have gained from doing synchronized swimming. An example would be going from "In the past, children have been forced to work under dangerous conditions" or "I trained every day of our ten-month season". Without imagery, these statements are bland, uninformative, and don't contribute much to the piece. What I included in both of my submitted works were "After some time had passed, people began to realize that by forcing a child to be cooped up in a factory all day, working dangerous conditions, and earning little to no money, they were taking away what it means to be a child." (Lange 5) and "...an athlete is expected to commit several hours a week for training in the water, and then individual hours outside of practice, training on land. We are also expected to perform at our best ability every day, no matter what, because a sport is not about the individual, but the team." (Lange 2). As I continue my college education, I would like to learn to better incorporate outside textual evidences that *enhance* my work, not simply supplement it. In the past, I feel as though I have done a good job of using research to support what I have to say, but I would like to be able to use the same process to benefit my pieces, rather than just reiterate my thoughts and opinions.

As a biology major, many of my papers are completely evidence based. It transfers over to my English classes, and I often write a paper where I include too much evidence and too little explanations. Even in High School, my English teacher often taught us to write essays with lots of evidence. I understand that all components of an essay are important, but my college science professors and high school English have shaped my writing. Some examples from a scientific essay that i had to include in my laboratory write-up where one can clearly see my scientific style of writing is \"For Sample A, the calculated amount of beta-blockers is less than 0%, therefore it is plausible that there are no drugs in the solution.

I think that it is necessary in any piece of literature for it to have a clear path for the reader to follow when you are trying to get a point across. If the reader is unsure what is being talked about or has a problematic time understanding the flow of the sentences, they can lose interest and become confused. If a reader becomes confused right from the beginning, the point that I'm trying to get across becomes lost in a jumble of sentences. My high school AP Literature teacher usually made sure to give a writing guide paper to not only me, but the whole class as well. This helped me organize my thoughts before I even started writing anything. An example would be that I write down an outline of my writing on my guided paper. So if I were writing about landmarks in New York, I'd write down each landmark that I was going to write about and the information about them in the order I was going to bring them up. I believe that learning how to have a fluent piece of work is part of being successful in writing. In the future I would like to enhance my writing by mostly knowing what I am going to write before I write it. I want my readers to not only understand what I write but also be engaged in it as well. I think that sometimes I get caught up in all of the information that I am trying to write about that I lose track of where I am putting it in my writing and if it makes sense where I put it. That's why I think it is so important to plan things ahead of time. I need stick to the plan that I came up with, unless I have some more creative ideas to incorporate that I can add without losing the main idea of my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Natalia Krol ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing, I focus on starting with a solid plan and outline. In doing this, it allows me to organize my thoughts and make my writing more focused. It also helps me determine my purpose for the piece. It is important to me because I tend to get very overwhelmed and frustrated when writing. Personally, I am very math oriented, so I dreaded writing papers. However, in high school, I had a teacher that gave me helpful advice. She told me to set a goal and create an equation to achieve that goal. In the past, teachers have told me the importance of outlines but, they never worked for me. If there is no structure in an essay, it is easy to get off topic and include pointless information. Looking at it as an equation helped me, because I was able to see all the "variables" that were necessary to develop my thesis. Then, after finishing the paper I can look back at this outline to make sure I covered everything I wanted. For example, I used this technique in an essay I wrote about *Song of Solomon* by Toni Morison. The goal of the essay was, "to discuss how it's illustrated that minorities experience different pressures to prove themselves in American culture." So, to achieve that goal I set up the equation, "discuss how she depicts the pressure through the portrayal and relationship between her characters + juxtapose those two characters + discuss the effects that had on the characters." After combining all those factors, it resulted in proving the thesis. Then, I was able to make a full outline of every point I wanted to bring up. Instead of bringing in many examples I saw throughout the book, or including irrelevant information, I stayed on topic and wrote a clear essay. I feel that there is always room for improvement in my writing. When I write, it is in a matter-of-fact tone and lacks detail. So, I hope to develop my ability to use descriptive language to make my writing more engaging as well as interesting. I think it is important because all my life I am going to be writing, whether it be emails, personal experiences, or stories. Regardless of what kind of writing, having people want to read your writing gives you a voice and platform. Possibly further expanding my vocabulary could aid in doing that. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Melanie Krieger ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus most on condensing my sentences. My first task when editing my papers, essays, journal entries, etc., is finding ways to get my point across and be as specific as possible, without having run-on sentences. I achieve this by using a more complex vocabulary and by taking the time to have multiple rough drafts. For example, instead of saying "Shakespeare is showing how much Juliet loves Romeo through dialogue using literary devices like metaphors and similes." I would say, "Through dialogue, Shakespeare uses metaphors and similes to demonstrate Romeo and Juliet's love." By being confident in condensing my sentences, I feel more confident in my work and am able to move on to other constructive writing skills. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I would like to work on bettering my spelling, so I don't need to rely on the internet or a dictionary to spell words correctly.

When writing argument essays I like to consciously focus on how to effectively make my point across by using transition words or sentences to engage and support my response. By using a high school English \"road map\" to a successful essay, I believe I have a valuable background to reference when I write my responses. The road map implied that as a reader, an individual does not want to hear the repeating words. A good writer must choose words to show a change in attitude. For example, phrases like \"next I will\...\", \"now I will\...\", do not strongly engage a reader in your work. The phrases stated above do not serve a purpose with strength behind an argument. In the road map, I was guided to find descriptive, direct, and supported phrases to establish my argument and response.Typically, a student may use transitions like \"In addition to the Navajo using growing as a holistic view, they used this\... to show their values\...\". However, in my knowledge of the road map I instead should say something along the lines of, \"While the Navajo used a vast concept of growing to show their holistic values, there is a recognizable and indisputable reason in which the Navajo used this concept for personal benefit.\" In my opinion, the newly phrased sentence has strength and direction in which the argument will go instead of simply choosing an explanation with no depth in their thinking. Now with that being sad, I would like to put my focus on developing a well identified thesis statement. I believe I do have notable skills in writing a thesis statement, however I do believe that there is always room for improvement and based on recent essays after revising I would like to address the \"weakness\" of my thesis statements. I would like them to become more direct in the sense that there is obvious support and emphasis on the impact the thesis statement will make in my essay. Sometimes I feel like I am too focused on using examples to support my claim rather than referring back to my thesis and making sure to include that within my explanations. That is where I am at fault, and where I would like to see growth in my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lucas Kollmer =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I tend to focus on paragraph structure by having a precise thesis.

The best way to give the reader insight as to what your paper will look like is by mentioning the topics of each paragraph in your thesis. For example, in a past paper, I wrote "Things that I found to hold important to who this person could be, a freshwater fishing license, a plane ticket to Los Angeles, license with age and D.O.B., and a blood donor card." In the introductory paragraph, I outlined the information that was going to be covered in the following paragraphs. When starting a new paragraph, I always refer to what I had said in the introduction to write a topic sentence. This further gives the paper more structure and consistency.

For example, I started a reflection about ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The Kite Runner]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ with "Amir does not try to stop Hassan, because he wants to get the kite to please Baba and win his affection."

This aspect is one of the first steps I take in my revision process. I've noticed that when I take my first drafts to a tutor or a teacher, many of my sources are not par and the quotes I use from those sources do not apply to the question. After I take it to a tutor, I begin to search for more relevant points that defend my argument in a more meaningful way. For example, in a US history essay from last semester, I used a quote from a website that I believed was up to par. The quote was, \"God expects every man and every woman to do his or her duty...\"(Brown). The question was "How did the social facts change in America?" I thought that my quote would be strong and relate to the question, but as I read it over, I realized that it really does not and when I asked my teacher to look it over, he said the source was not par too. I found a more promising quote from a novel that was approved by my teacher and it stated, "Workmen who continued to drink and carouse and stay away from the church were no longer considered errant children; they were free moral agents who had chosen to oppose the Coming Kingdom." This quote is more relevant to how some American lives changed due to drinking. Finding a good quote from a good source is important because it needs to connect to the question being asked or else it'll be wrong. After I find a good quote, I then make sure it connects to my other points in the essay and flows nicely. Honestly, the aspect I just talked about is the aspect that I would like to focus on a lot because it seems that in all my essays, it's always the evidence and sources that don't apply.

This is important in order to make sure the rest of the paper is focused and has a clear point, as well as to ensure that the reader knows exactly what they will be reading about. In order to be certain that my introduction is organized, I follow a guide that my ninth grade English teacher shared with my class. She said to think of the introduction like a slice of pizza. At the top, it is broad, starting with a general statement that is usually common knowledge, or maybe just outside information. For example, "Sometimes life can become overwhelmingly chaotic, which causes people to want a life of simplicity." This statement is general because it does not yet mention the poem I am writing about. The next part is a little further down the "slice" so it is a little less broad, still somewhat general, but it introduces what is being written about, like a specific book or poem. To illustrate, "The poem 'Awaking in New York,' by Maya Angelou, explores this idea as the speaker shares their feelings." Now the reader knows the subject of which I am writing about, but still not my thesis. At the very end of the "pizza slice" is the narrow statement, or the thesis which is very specific. For example, "This idea of living among so much chaos and conflict is portrayed through connotation and metaphors." With this statement, the reader knows exactly what my paper will be about.

One area of writing in which I would like to work on and develop here at Geneseo, is to broaden my vocabulary all throughout my essays. One consistent criticism from my English teachers throughout the years is that I need to vary my vocabulary, and not have too much repetition of one word.

When teachers would grade my papers in high school there would usually be comments about how well I put quotes into a paper and explained them well enough to where they were very strong points into my essay. My ability to put together a solid argument has often been disrupted by one of my biggest flaws with my writing. What I believe is my biggest problem while putting together evidence is my ability to organize it to make my argument or topic as strong as possible. Earlier this year I wrote a paper for Environmental Issues on the effect public transportation has on the atmosphere. The comments I received back from my professor is that my evidence was there but the way I formulated my paper was jumbled and all over the place. Even when I go back to revise, I don't notice how unorganized my information is. Whether it be swapping places of paragraphs or just putting quotes before others it would really help my argument if I organized them better. An example of this would be if I started discussing the effects of trains on the atmosphere and then the effects of mass transportation in general. It would make more sense if I discussed mass transportation and then went in depth with different types of transportation like trains. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Marina Kiesling ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Marina Kiesling]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of the strengths in my writing is the flow and cohesiveness throughout my essays. I think I do a good job in making my papers coherent and connected throughout so the reader doesn't get confused. For example, I recently wrote a paper for my humanities class on Plato's ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Republic, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[in which I wrote, "There is not one person who can make the decision for everyone on what their morals should be and how they should act and behave in society. They are meant to have perfect morals but that is only based on the morals that Plato believed were "perfect". We can't be sure that guardians won't be corrupted by power and base their "moral" judgements on what they want rather than what is actually best for the people", and i changed it to something that sound less choppy and more concise like, "One person cannot make the decision for everyone on what their morals should be and how they should act and behave in society. The guardians are meant to have perfect morals but that is only based on the morals that Plato believed were "perfect". One can't be sure that guardians won't be corrupted by power and base their "moral" judgements on what they want rather than what is actually best for the people." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In order to improve my writing in the future, I know I need to do better at expanding on my points and fully explaining what I'm trying to say. I tend to write in the most succinct way possible and end up leaving points out which can make my writing seem too brief. This has always been one of my biggest struggles in writing and in order to improve it I'm going to try to focus more on details and try to go more in depth with my analysis of the topic. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Ketteler ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} 1.

In high school, my english teachers wanted us to be able to write a introduction that got to the point fast, while also giving important and concise background information. This was all in an effort to help develop an in depth but short paragraph that readers would be able to understand. Here is an example from my senior exit project,]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ "\....A current problem that our nation faces today is the lack of health insurance for people across our country.

Evidence that actually is strong and adds to the piece that I am writing. I have found that I do add relevant evidence but it isn't strong and doesn't add depth or perspective to my essay. This is typically where I would lose points on an essay.

There are many formulaic ways to present quotes in a manner that makes the writing clear and cohesive. I used to simply have an introductory sentence, then a sentence for the quote, followed by several sentences for analysis. After receiving knowledgeable writing advice from teachers and professors, I know to utilize templates and my own creativity more often. An example is that I now add a brief introductory statement like "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Author ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[complicates matters further when she writes that\..." before I insert a quote into my writing. In order to maintain a level of sophistication in my writing, it is essential that I am clear in what I write, and that I don't use the same introduction tools with every quote. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue to write academic essays, I hope to incorporate more sophisticated syntax into my writing. I want to be able to write at a higher level, while still conveying my message properly so that I can be the best writer I can be.

I believe the Introduction is the most important part of an essay because it is the part that hooks the audience and it is better when an essay comes off as interesting from the very beginning. I have become a somewhat better writer over the years from some of my teachers, but I mainly developed my skills from my Father, who is a newspaper writer. He always told me that the major aspect of any piece of writing is the introduction, and more importantly the thesis statement. A good thesis statement clearly states to the audience, the topic of the essay and takes a stern position on the authors' attitude towards the topic. My writing in my younger days, would have a thesis statement somewhere along the lines of, "This paper will consider the advantages and disadvantages of certain restrictions on free speech." Over the years have been giving the tools to become a better thesis statement writer. For the above thesis a revised version could be, "Even though there may be considerable advantages to restricting hate speech, the possibility of chilling open dialogue on crucial racial issues is too great and too high a price to pay. Going forward, one thing I want to focus on is writing conclusions because I have not mastered a way to close out arguments without restating exactly the information from the introduction.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Isaiah Kelly ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} An aspect I often focus on when I'm writing is using my introduction as a generalization of the thesis, so it gives more background information on the topic. I try to make them interesting to get the audience to *want* to read my writing. I learned to write this way from my sophomore and senior English teacher back in high school. He always told me to keep the intro almost like a triangle, so the beginning is general, and continues to get closer to the point. An example of an intro I just wrote for my INTD 105 begins with "Being black in the United States is not easy. From the covert racism embedded in the structure of our nation, to the citizens who are open about being racists, there is no simple route for an African American in the U.S. to become successful. The idea of discrimination based on biological race was around much longer than the foundation of the United States, but it played a massive part in the development of the nation. The slave trade trickled into the States by the popularization of the use of slaves between the 18th and 19th centuries, and the idea was taken from some European nations and colonies. Slavery was created as a racial social system that was directly related to the darkness of your skin, or African ancestry" That introduction is cut off a little because it's a lot longer than that, but my goal is to improve upon shortening my introductions, because while they have a lot of information, they are also too lengthy and take away from the main point. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sean Keenan ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ One aspect of writing that I already focus on when I am revising my papers is to make sure I use commas properly. If commas aren't used in the correct manner, it distracts the reader and throws off the paper as a whole. A lot of the time when I go back to read my rough drafts, I will have many run-on sentences. It is very easy for me to do this when I write because when I have a thought, I just want to write it down without thinking of commas. When I was in middle school and high school, my Mom would read over and revise my rough drafts. Since she is a very good writer, she would always note to me how my commas weren't used in the right places. So, now when I revise, I really try to get all of my commas in the right spot. An example I have of comma misuse in my last rough draft is, " ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[She suggests that people of different race are still of the same human character and if were mixed and matched with one another, there would be no significant change." The correct way of this sentence should go as follows, "She suggests that people of different race are still of the same human character, and if were mixed and matched with one another, there would be no significant change." At first I did not have a comma between "character" and "and". When I was reading it back to myself during revision it didn't sound correct. Now I know that whenever you are reading back an essay, if you pause during the sentence there needs to be a comma there. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ In the future I want to work on all aspects of my writing. However, one that I want to focus on the most would be the use of higher level vocabulary. Now that I am in college I want to expand my knowledge of complex words. I feel as though it makes papers sound more proper and unique. What I can do to improve on this would be to read more books and articles. Doing this will definitely increase my vocabulary greatly. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Margaret Keane ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Margaret Keane INTD 106 What I focus on the most in my writing is my ability to use evidence. I believe I am able to blend my evidence very well with my writing to construct a coherent argument. I think that although facts are presented, they need to always be backed by evidence. In my writing I try to make the evidence part of my central argument and manipulate it in a way to support or reject my thesis. Whenever I begin writing I always think back to my AP Euro teacher and his rubric that was graded so heavily on the use of evidence. He stressed the use of documents as evidence and wanted them to be perfectly blended as an extension of our own writing. An example of this would be when I start off with "In*"Emperor Taizong on Effective Government",* "...none of them gets to be too strong or weak" (Ebrey 113). This is what I will be implementing into my own government to prevent removing power from relatives". Then from here I would add more of my voice to strengthen my argument. "I will be implementing policies from *"Emperor Taizong on Effective Government".* I will propose removing power from relatives "so that none of them gets to be too strong or weak" (Ebrey 113)". In Geneseo I would like to improve in my ability to analyze to form a stronger argument. I think evidence is important but analyzing is my own voice and because of this I find it a struggle in making strong, concrete statements that can carry my thesis through the essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Farah Katadeen ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I tend to focus on re-establishing the important concepts in my essays and how they correlate to the overall discussion. Being able to concisely relate arguments and discussion back to the main topic is important because while it is vital to include arguments into a discussion, there is no use for an argument if it is seemingly misplaced or irrelevant. It is also important to tie back to the main topic of discussion so that the reader does not lose their train of thought or become bored with the essay itself. Since I already focus on this area of my academic writing and continue to do so, I can honestly say that I have improved in this aspect of my writing. For example, in a more recent essay that I have written I state "Therefore, the father is conceding to his "guilt" even though he has nothing to be guilty for." This is an example of how I have improved at tieing back my arguments to my central topic because my central topic in this essay was that the father in the novel pleaded that he was guilty despite being innocent. In the quote, I tie the argument I had just made to the central topic of the father's plea of guilt. However, this skill regarding my academic writing would not be where it is as of right now without the guidance I have received throughout my high school career. My skill and improvement is owed to my high school history teacher who was the first to point out some of the obvious mistakes I made in my writing and to give me advice as to how to improve it.\ In the future, I would like to concentrate on improving how I structure and execute writing my introductions and conclusions. I struggle with writing introductions and conclusions the most and tend to wait to the end of my essay to write them both and when I do they are not to my satisfaction. I struggle with this aspect of my writing because I find it hard to come up with a "hook" or interesting first line and I fear being repetitive of monotonous within my introduction and conclusion. I hope to find ways to think out of the box and be able to write interesting introductions and conclusions that meet my own standards. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Andrew Kareeparampil ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I believe that writing in a concise manner is imperative in academic writing: it allows readers to clearly and easily understand that points I want to convey; moreover, it allows myself to focus on my main ideas and avoid deviation to irrelevant ones. Whenever I revise essays, I attempt to cut-out unnecessary words. This skill was first developed in my senior year of high school when my English teacher lectured on the importance of brevity and taught that it was among the most important aspects of academic writing. He critiqued a essay rough draft, in which I described co-workers at a restaurant in clear detail, stating, "The local Wendy's crew includes an eighteen-year-old cook whose parents made him move into an apartment, a young Salvadoran immigrant who has two other minimum wage jobs, \[and\] a manager who works fourteen hours on a daily basis\..." While such detail conveyed hardships fast food employees bear, it was an unnecessary aspect of my essay that my teacher viewed as "filler." The overall goal of this essay was to comment on my previous work experiences, and in revising this work, I cut-out this line and focused on what the job taught me. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As a new student at Geneseo, I want to develop a better ability to move from one point to another.

As I write, I begin each body paragraph with a central idea, or claim, and then use the rest of that paragraph to elaborate. For example, in a previous paper I began a paragraph with "postnatal depression was also shown to affect the child's development and risk for MDD." The rest of that paragraph focused only on depression as a biological risk factor and its effects on child development. The following paragraph began a new idea stating "maternal depression has not only been shown to affect biological risks for MDD but has also been shown to pose environmental risks," making the switch from biological factors in the first paragraph, to environmental factors in the second. I consistently focus on perfecting structure because I've been previously told through peer and instructor feedback that my writing can sometimes stray from the main idea and become confusing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Following basic structure is important not only for the writer, but for the reader too. It is ideal for your audience to be able to read through your writing without difficulty, making the context of your paper easier to understand. Basic structure is a tool for the writer, making it easier to keep thoughts and information organized. By perfecting structure, you strengthen your argument and highlight the content of your paper. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect I would like to work on this semester is transitioning. I often struggle with finding ways to transition from one topic to another. There are times where I feel overwhelmed because one topic may be incredibly different from the next, making it more difficult to bridge the gap. Transition statements are just as important as basic structure because they also add to clarity and make your writing more concise and easy to follow. I hope to learn how to create clear transitions statements and how to connect two very different concepts together during the upcoming semester. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Uniqua Jones ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Uniqua Jones Conventions of College Writing: Self-Reflect \#1 An aspect of academic writing I focus on consciously is my use of vocabulary when writing papers. When I first started writing academic papers I did not really check my word choice because it seemed tedious and redundant. Now, I am more advanced as well as aware of the words I choose to use in my papers. I understand the importance of vocabulary in a paper because it helps the writing flow more smoothly when there\'s structure to each point you are trying to make. It helps the reader understand the overall main points you were trying to get out the writing without it sounding too redundant. What I use to help me figure out if a word should be replaced is a skill I was taught by my middle school teacher, reading backward. Reading backward line from line helps me pinpoint if I should replace a word. I try to read to find if I used a word too many times and I add action verbs when I feel my writing needs to be more engaging. An example of this can be of a few sentences I recently edited, "Sara Marcus says in chapter four how the members of Riot Grrrl DC relationships strengthened, they held meetings discussing anything from politics, told personal stories and even spent the night at each other\'s houses. The group started to become a tight-knight group many realized that many newcomers did not come back for meeting possibly because they felt exclusive." Without reading it backward I would think everything is okay and does not need to be looked over. However when I did read it backward and edited there was a notable difference, "Sara Marcus details how the members of Riot Grrrl DC bonds strengthened through various meetings they held. However many newcomers often did not come back leaving the question of if the Riot Grrrls were becoming too close-knit." By rereading it backward I was able to cut down my sentence and still get my message across to the reader. In the future, I want to focus more on deciding when to and when not to be specific when writing. I think figuring that out and putting it into practice will overall help me to become a better writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katherine Johnson =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Something that I focus on already is being able to make my thesis statements more specific and precise rather than broad and general. I struggled with this throughout high school, and in English 203 last semester, I feel as though I was able to strengthen this skill, and am much more conscious of it. I feel confident that I can come up with a strong thesis statement that functions as a strong jumping off point for me to write a strong essay. My professor last semester really helped me to understand the importance of a strong thesis statement, and how it can ultimately lead to successful execution of a paper, particularly addressing the prompt and remaining relevant. An example of this is my thesis for my final paper comparing and contrasting two works, Frenzy and The Bacchae. Originally, my thesis was too broad to introduce a precise and articulate paper. For example, I move from a thesis statement like \"Frenzy functions as a way to bridge the gap between The Bacchae and modern society.\" to \"Frenzy\'s addition of an omnipotent narrator allows an insight into an ancient storyline that makes it relevant and applicable to modern society.\" Going forward, something about my writing that I\'d like to be more conscious of and work towards improving is my ability to incorporate research and information from academic sources more naturally into my writing. I enjoy gathering my sources, but sometimes struggle to find a natural-sounding way to embed them into my writing. I think that is something that only gets easier with time and practice and I hope to be more aware of that in the future and get better at it so that my paper flows more smoothly. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brynn Johnson =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on my word choice and the vocabulary I am actively writing with. Throughout what I have written in the past, I am well aware that in my first draft I reuse many words because the terms are already in the forefront of my mind. Using better vocabulary is extremely important because it can help to better convey what image you are portraying and show the reader that you have more to offer. An example would be, \"Fake news spreads around the world when there are new opinions,\" that I changed to, \"Fake news has been spreading around the world, as soon as anyone has a polarized opinion to express,\". These quotes were taken from a paper that I had written recently, and constantly reread. I strive to use different words to focus in on what my ideas are. Throughout the learning process of INTD 105 and 106, I\'d like to add to my vocabulary, but more specifically I want to focus on keeping more concise on my thoughts in my writing. Tangents help sometimes to explain writing, I think I find myself running off too far and losing my original plan or idea on the way. Being able to focus on the main points and plan of my writing will help me to write faster and be able to write a better paper that makes more sense. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hung Jin Jin ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write an academic paper, I mostly focus on articles. I have received a lot of guidance on the uses of articles from the Writing 101 class. Following is an example from one of my essays I had to write for the class. In my first draft, I wrote "the Main Street." However, my professor corrected it explaining that there should be no article before "Main Street" because it is a name. Since I made many mistakes like this, now I know how to correct my writing. I think learning to use proper article is an important skill in writing academic papers. It is because, when wrong articles are used in academic papers, it easily distracts readers. Therefore, the writing becomes weak and fails to convey the meaning as the author wanted it to be. One aspect that I want to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo is how to write academically. This includes knowing how to use different tones of writings for different purposes. As an international student, I realized, sometimes it is rather my tone than grammar that I struggle the most. Therefore, to effectively convey my point to readers, I realized it is important to know how to use different tones of writings. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hannah Jewell =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I tend to focus on the word choice, or diction I include throughout my writing in order to give meaning and clarity to the points I am making. I often use a variety of transition words to increase the fluidity of my thoughts and the effect that the order of my thoughts creates. I also may use synonyms that sound more sophisticated, increasing the quality of my writing, but not to the point that it becomes unclear. If one thought does not provide a smooth transition to the next, then I believe I can improve that by using one of the many transition words on the list that my AP English teachers in high school provided for me. For example, I may begin by bluntly stating two ideas such as "Antigone is more than willing to go against the desires of her uncle in an effort to do what pleases the gods, who matter most according to her" and "Ismene is in opposition of this because she does not want her sister to disobey Creon and risk the dangers of being punished." Since these are two separate ideas that can essentially be connected, I may use the transition word "however" to show that one character is responding to another in a clear and fluid manner. In the future, I would like to improve upon the way I organize and explain my thoughts. I believe that I refer to the author's words instead of my own thoughts on those words. Instead of merely summarizing, I believe it is necessary to spend more time analyzing the text itself. By doing this, I will able to further prove the points I am trying to make and overall create a stronger argument. Analysis will allow me to engage in a conversation about the topic I am addressing instead of only restating information that is already accessible to readers. If I am using in-text citations, I plan to better my writing by using the ICE method (Identify-Cite-Explain) I learned in high school, so I can include my own thoughts in addition to the text I am already referring to. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Claire Jennings ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Claire Jennings INTD 106 One aspect I focus on in my writing is the inclusion of too many details when trying to get a point across. A simple metaphor or idea I try to explain is might be turned into something hard to comprehend as I attempt to explain the full concept of a simple meaning, and how it ties into the essay. When a simple point is turned into an extensive explanation with many concepts, it often becomes too difficult to digest, therefore causing a lack of focus or interest in the reader. I focus on cutting down on a long explanation to get to a point quickly, so I can instead move on to other equally important topics. I feel that condensing my ideas effectively improves the flow of my essays. For example, a longer, run-on type of sentence such as "the sense of hopeless belonging we identify within them and the places they inhabit, most adequately represents the racially concurrent internal and external struggles of African Americans in the modern age of America" could be condensed to say "the sense of hopelessness represents the internal and external struggles of African Americans in the modern age of America". In an attempt not to include "fluff" or obscure embellishing I try to narrow down the idea to create a more cohesive writing and reading experience. In high school it was taught that to better an essay, it must be rid of the any extra details that are not important in supporting a claim or topic.\ In future endeavors I hope to create a more sophisticated tone or "voice" if you will, in my writing. The best writers have a clear developed stance and voice that they use effectively to improve their work and I hope to find just that. As time goes on, and as more common knowledge is acquired, I hope to find my voice and make it clear in my writing. Perhaps this way my arguments will be strengthened and more convincing, and readers will find it easier to comprehend my work. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jocelyn Jenis =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my academic writing I already focus on when revising my drafts is varying word choice throughout my papers. Throughout high school, I had been taught the importance of keeping your writer engaged or entertained to want to keep reading more. It is difficult to do that when your essay is repetitive and lacks variation. In the last essay I wrote there was a common theme I was trying to reiterate of progress not being made in racial prejudice. In one part I wrote, "As soon as there is believed to be progress in eliminating racial prejudice, tragedy strikes leaving Baldwin back where he started". Later in the same paragraph I use the same theme to analyze, but rephrase the idea as, "While Baldwin was under the impression he was welcome at the diner, since he was served there four previous times, he would come to find that there was no progress being made". Both enforce the theme, but are expressed in different ways. This skill is important to have when writing because it keeps your reader interested in what you are writing about. It is easy to lose interest when the writing lacks variation. The easiest way to become better at using different word choices is expanding your vocabulary or even using a thesaurus as long as you replace words correctly. While writing at Geneseo, I hope to acquire the skills to effectively form better thesis statements and finish essays with stronger conclusions. These parts of writing are what I believe I struggle with the most and wish I could improve on. I find the conclusions difficult because I find myself being too repetitive of my introduction.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Zachary Jencik ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I try to maintain an organization to it that makes it easier to follow and more put together. I do this because keeping a piece well organized allows me as a writer to convey my thoughts or stance in a much more efficient way. Organizing my own thoughts when writing them down relieves the reader of having to reorganize my thoughts on their own. I tend to do this by establishing my argument, or my thesis, at the beginning of the essay. In the introduction, I will list out my arguments in support of my thesis in the order that I will talk about them in the essay. In my English class in my Junior year of high school, I was taught how key organizational skills are in effectively demonstrating your point and getting a message across to your reader in a structured way. An unstructured essay is guaranteed to cause miscommunication between the author and the reader, and that can affect the way the reader interprets the author's message. In a letter, I wrote to the CEO of YouTube. In my introductory paragraph, I said, "Your demonetization policy is harmful to the community because it discourages content creators, reduces the income that they depend on, and is used unfairly to censor content." I stated my claim and listed the supporting arguments for it. In the next paragraph, I spoke about how the policy discourages creators. The following paragraph listed examples of peoples' reduced income and how it affected them. The one after that spoke about the censorship issue. I state my argument in a simplified, brief format in the intro and elaborate on it in order in the rest of the essay. I try to do this in any argumentative piece, or any writing where I must make a claim and support it. In the future, I would like to focus on integrating quotes from sources more naturally into my writing. When I do it, it's unnatural and awkward and interrupts the flow of the rest of the piece. The only way to effectively work on this issue is to integrate more quotes into my writing and practice it until it feels natural to me. I need to take note of quotes from the text that speak to me and use them later to develop an argument rather than making my argument and searching for quotes after the fact and hoping they work well. I know that if I continue to practice with quotes it will only get easier. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cole Janda ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The feature I focus on the most while writing papers, is trying to say more without putting in useless filler. My papers tend to contain extraneous and long-winded sentences that don't add to the quality, only the length. This often leads the final product to not contain enough pertinent information, and make the paper somewhat dull, taking three pages to say something that only takes a paragraph. An example of this is as follows; instead of writing "The laws made in colonial Virginia were created to give racism a legal foundation. In order to prevent rebellion, black indentured servants were punished much much worse than white servants as a way of making them seem like less than human, creating a rift between the two groups." I could write something more brief, but still convey the same information, such as "Racial punishment laws in Virginia were created to socially separate the black and white lower classes."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue my writing career at Geneseo and beyond, I want to improve my ability to incorporate in content from my sources.

If I don't, my paper ends up being 5 pages over what it should have been. Not only is this clearly more annoying to read and grade, but the overall quality of my writing drops significantly. I initially learned this from my AP US History teacher, when he told me that my 6-page paper could have been a 2-page paper with a higher grade. For example, in that essay, I wrote "When he arrived in the New World, Christopher Columbus claimed an island in the Bahamas for Spain, and also discovered the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola on his first voyage before returning home.". While technically correct, I included far too many clauses. I also included too many irrelevant details, when I could have simply written, "When Columbus arrived in the New World, he claimed several islands for Spain before he headed back to Spain." When I focus on this skill, my writing tends to be more concise and easier to read. During my time at Geneseo, I intend to avoid using complex words when it's not necessary in my writing. This goes along with my editing strategy mentioned earlier -- using longer or more complex words make it more difficult to read my writing. My plan is to use longer words only if my meaning is so specific that no other words will do. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Linda Jaimes ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Linda Jaimes]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [After looking over a rough draft, I look at the structure of my writing. What I mean by this is that I will re-read a paragraph and will notice sentences that should be placed in different areas. For example, when using quotes in an essay, I wouldn't have a smooth transition into the quote. It was just thrown into the paragraph without any context as to the importance of the quote. Here is an example of my rough draft; In the essay by James Baldwin, "Notes of a Native Son," he wrote about his life in Harlem as a child and into adulthood. "I had discovered the weight of the white people in the world. I saw that this had been for my ancestors and now would be for me an awful thing to live with and that the bitterness which helped kill my father could also kill me." After reading the rough draft I realized nobody knew anything about his father. So I added, "He always identified his father as a bitter old man, who never trusted white men, and as a child this was hard for him to understand.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Baldwin told himself he wouldn't become like his old man, but his outlook changed when he experienced the real world himself."

If too many words are used when trying to convey a message, the meaning can be lost. One of my professors made it a point to teach that concise writing was important, especially in terms of writing pieces for publication whether it be in a magazine or academic journal. If submissions are too long, or too short, they may be rejected, so it is important to be able to write in a way that allows you to abide by guidelines when necessary. For example, abstracts of academic papers must be very short, often times only 100 words, while at the same time be able to summarize the entire paper: Facial expressions can transmit information about individuals almost instantly. Factors such as the presence of a smile or no smile may influence perceptions of individuals on scales of likeability and desire to be in someone's presence. In the present study, subjects rated photographs of individuals that were either smiling, half-smiling, or not smiling, on their likeability and how happy they would feel if they were with them. The more emotionally expressive the individual in the photo was, the higher the rating for both likeability and how happy subjects would feel. The findings support previous theories of emotional contagion and evaluation of others and provide new information regarding these ideas in a less formal setting. In the future, I\'d like to to focus more on this, because I feel like it can always be improved. Specifically, I think it will just take more time proof reading and really going through my work and making sure I have done things like used active verbs instead of passive verbs when applicable, or use words like \"instead\" rather than \"as opposed to\". ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mia Iversen ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Mia Iversen]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Professor Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [10 February 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As a writer, I have always focused on a good balance between quoted and cited material and my own thoughts about a certain subject. This is a very important skill as many young students often tend to relay information when writing academically, forgetting to include their ideas or information on the topic they are writing about. Throughout my years in high school, my teachers would consistently remind me to "put myself in the paper" instead of relying on other authors knowledge and simply quoting a few sources many times within my academic writings. This encouragement from my teachers made me realize that although my ideas were high school notions, they were still important to include in my works and would create a collaboration with well-known scholars instead of a reiteration of their pieces. For example, I would write in a way that highlighted someone else\'s knowledge such as " 'Personally, if I were to experience an emergency, I would instinctively reach for my cell phone to call for help. Given today's heavy reliance on cell phones, I find it hard to justify spending around \$400,000 to install and \$75,000 for upkeep annually on these soon-to-be obsolete systems (Reppert,1).' Not only are they expensive, but most of the time, they are not used...", however, I began to use shorter quotes throughout my writings and used them less frequently as well to avoid repeating what I'm already writing about. I think these writing skills are important for young writers to learn, alongside the general rules of grammar, spelling, and adequate vocabulary for any type of academic writing throughout their lives as expectations grow not only in universities and academia but also in the working world. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One very important skill that I believe I need to improve on is stable transitions from one topic or paragraph to the next. I feel as though my papers often seem choppy even when I plan my outlines and have all of my information in advance. I feel as though it is important for my writing to flow better, not only to make more sense and be more informative to the reader, but also to appeal to them and be pleasant to read. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cally Issidoridis =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I am writing, I typically use descriptive language when trying to depict something of high importance. I feel that this is very crucial in writing, both fictional and non-fictional, because it grabs and maintain the reader's attention throughout your work. I have picked up and practiced this method throughout my career as a writer, but especially during my high school years as I have found that it is truly effective and makes my writing more engaging. My high school English teacher tried to enforce it as best as she possibly could and I have tried to use this skill more in my writing. An example I would use would be instead of saying "The grass is green and I like it", I would say "I have always admired the true depth of color of the grass". This makes my writing more meaningful and personal, rather than generic and basic. In my upcoming years at Geneseo, I hope to accomplish a few things in my writing. First, I wish to make my writing a bit more sophisticated. Although this sounds quite miniscule to some, I think that it is very important in order to be taken seriously. Oftentimes, I find my writing to seem of lower standards than everyone else and it is something that I have been quite self-conscious about as a young writer. Also, another thing I hope to accomplish is to use more vocabulary because I feel that it can help me display my point in a better way using different language. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jacob Houseman ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on the creation of a solid, reliable thesis that serves as a foundation for work with the information that I have researched on whatever subject I am writing about. I consider the thesis the most important part of writing a paper because it provides a structure for your body paragraphs that effectively conveys the point you are trying to argue. If what you are arguing is affectively stated in the introduction (or, in general, the beginning) of a piece of work, then arguing for these points logically in the body paragraphs comes naturally. I can achieve this by sticking to a strategy from my high school English teacher, where a thesis is created in either a closed or open format, depending on the type and length of something I'm writing. In an argumentative essay that is meant to be short and concise, a closed thesis such as "Harry Benjamin's research on transsexuality contributed to the well-being of his transsexual patients socially, medically, and emotionally" will keep me on track for the rest of the writing process. In a longer work, an open thesis can provide more options for argument development, thus giving the writer freedom, making it easier to write more. For example, "Harry Benjamin effectively changed the lives of many transsexuals with his groundbreaking research" would leave the writer open to any significant way Benjamin affected the lives of his patients. In the future, I'd like to find methods of staying on track during writing, as I tend to go off track of the point I'm trying to argue, and can sometimes include extraneous information not important to my argument. I would achieve this by researching more and creating more drafts as I write. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kiera Horan ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of my writing that I consciously focus on improving is my ability to write my sentences in a more fluid, aesthetic, and comprehensive way. Often when I write, I get caught up in ideas and points I want to make that I become disorganized and I feel that this significantly stifles my ability to be articulate. I have noticed that I will attempt to fit explanations in one complete sentence that often leaves them lengthy, disorganized, and confusing. For example, in an essay I had wrote, "I feel that the concept of no emotion is ultimately a key element to the emotion in general, as all beings are formed in opposites, as we cannot have good without bad or happy without sad." In this one sentence, I attempted to make a point and give an example that supports my analysis, however, instead I mostly combined different sentence fragments and made a long run-on sentence. To revise my sentence, I would separate the different points into different sentences, like so: "While it may sound complex, I feel that having no emotion is a key element of emotion in general. This can be understood, as all things have contrasts, as we are formed in opposites. For example, we cannot have good without bad or happy without sad. Therefore, there could not be 'emotional' if there was no 'emotionless.'" It may take more time for me to explain my point when I separate the sentences as so, but I feel it makes my writing easier to follow for the reader, and clarity is an important aspect of writing one should strive to achieve. One aspect that I would like to develop fully as a Geneseo student is mastering my skills at citing sources or textual evidence. I notice that I sometimes have confusion of exactly when or where to cite an embedded quote. I plan to research proper MLA format for citations and will ask my instructors what their preferences are in the matter. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Bradey Hogan ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As I am revising my drafts, I mainly focus on my vocabulary as I am writing because I believe that by using certain powerful words, you can make your reader so much more intrigued with the story. As I begin my writing, I make it very simple. When I finish my drafts, that is when I will go over my paper and change words from simple, boring ones to exciting and more interesting ones. For example, changing bad to devastating or changing happy to delighted. It is the simple change of a word that can make small details more important. I am relatively assured that I can attain these goals by following what my old English teachers would tell me. They would tell me to act like an intelligent young woman and allow myself to go out of my comfort zone; to just look for synonyms of boring words. I was fairly lazy and just by doing something as small as changing a few words around really improved by writing. This skill is significant to writing because it really makes your work stand out from others. You sound more insightful and brings more attention to your work. One skill I would like to see myself improve on while my time at Geneseo is not focusing all my attention on factual information. It is good to have your own voice in your writing as well as examples from others to support yourself. I base most of my papers on information solely based from other people, when in fact, I could have some purposeful information to be provided. These skills will really help benefit in the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Claire Hofmeister =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One thing I primarily focus on when I am writing is the readability of my essay. I think it is important that the grammar is perfect. This includes sentence structure, word choice, and agreement. Sentence structure is important in order for the essay to flow nicely. If there are too many run-ons or sentence fragments, the essay will not make sense. Additionally, if you use the wrong version of a word and mix up contractions and words of possession, the piece will not make sense. Agreement is also important because you need your pronouns to match up and you need to match the number of subjects in the sentence. If you put a plural verb in a sentence with a singular subject, the sentence will not make sense. All these aspects are essential when writing an essay. If the writing is not readable, nobody will understand the point you are trying to emphasize and your work will be discredited. One example of my own writing where I really payed attention to the readability of it is this except from an essay I wrote for a college application, "The key to living a meaningful life is simpler than many people believe it is. Having a commitment to the common good is all you need to make a significant difference in the world. Certainly an exceptional education and a benevolent character also play a vital role in this too but a desire to improve the community around you is what actually matters. That is why receiving an exceptional Jesuit education is important to me. During my four years in high school, I have focused on helping others through my volunteer work. I would love to continue to do this during my college years and into adulthood." One thing I would like to improve upon in my writing is developing my own voice. I have noticed that sometimes my writing can sound generic with no emotion. A voice is especially important when writing a persuasive essay since you need passion behind your writing. You cannot convince a reader of an argument if there is no voice in the writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Duncan Ho ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} A mistake that I make when I write is to not write any drafts. I like to have the whole essay planned out in my head before I start putting words on paper, but usually, even if the words sound perfect when I think about them, I realize they are flawed as soon as I write them down. As a result, I would repeatedly write single sentences, erase them, and rewrite them again until they are "perfect". This makes writing even the simplest paragraphs a time-consuming process. A moment of reflection tells me the reason why I keep writing like this is that I don't prioritize the different aspects of writing. While writing, instead of focusing just on the content and logic of the essay, I would have a mental checklist of things that the words have to satisfy: correct spelling and grammar, precise usage, conciseness, etc. These are things that INTD 106 terms "lower-order concerns for proof-reading." What I am doing is actually writing, editing, and proof-reading, all at the same time. Having read INTD 106's module on the writing process, I learned that the writing process should be broken down into stages: getting the thesis statement and broad arguments across in the first draft, revising for organization and clarity in the second draft, and finally correcting for grammar and spelling in the final version. I am confident that if I follow the guidelines set out by this module and focus only on a few aspects of writing at each stage, then my writing would be much more efficient. I understand that the prompt for this particular assignment is to write about one single aspect of writing that I already focus on in the revision process, and to give a worked example, but since I don't write drafts, I therefore have no revision process and no worked examples to offer. However, in keeping with the spirit of a self-reflection paper, I have identified an aspect of the writing process that I could improve on and offered a potential solution, as obvious as it may be. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: William Hecht =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When it comes to my academic writing, I tend to focus on getting to the point of the essay or paper. This may sound like a general skill, yet it takes a lot to move away from unnecessary embellishments and loose diction in an academic essay and simply discussing the topic at hand. This allows the reader to focus solely on what the essay means without getting distracted. Elementary school students, at least in my case, learn to write creatively and are taught how to properly use metaphors, allegories, and personification, yet do not properly learn how to write in the professional or academic sense. I learned this in my high school AP US History class, where it did not matter what extra words and metaphors were in our essay, but simply what was being said in the academic sense. For example, I wrote in an academic paper, "Christian existentialists believe in the idea of free will and individuals controlling their existence...". This statement is to the point and succinct, whereas the statement, "So what do Christian existentialists believe in? Well, God's will acts as the waves of the ocean..." or a statement along those lines almost dances around the point. This skill is great for the creative writing, yet not in the academic sense. In terms of a skill that I believe I could improve on, I believe that I can improve the sources I use in my essays. I usually don't use many sources in my essays as I never know where to find more sources that compliment my argument. Perhaps using the databases and finding sources that present only part of the argument can help me by giving me a foundation, at least, to form my own argument using my ideas combined with that of a scholarly essay. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katherine Hayes ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Over the years I have worked on creating a more organized and purposeful piece of writing. Before I learned to explain the evidence that I used in my writing, I would simply state a fact or quote and ignore analyzing its relevance to the thesis. Demonstrating how the evidence from other sources supports the writer's theory is vital for the reader to better comprehend the point of view of the writer. In high school, a major part of my English classes included writing several research papers each year, in which I had to realize the importance of providing an explanation for outside information. The best research paper that I have ever written---a paper about the morality and impact of 3D bioprinting on society\-- involved a lot of preparation, and an even more in-depth revision process. In this paper I discussed the positive effects 3D bioprinting can have on society: in the counter-argument, I discussed that the opposition believes that there is little research that supports the safety of bioprinting. I quoted the opposition stating "Risking the patient's acceptability in unacceptable": I replied by simply stating that bioprinting is a risk that needs to be taken for the patient to survive. After revision, I rewrote and enhanced my response. I went into detail about the research that has been done to prove that the benefits outweigh the risk, and the risk is a necessary step for the patient to take for their best chance of survival. As I continue to write I would like to focus on concentrating my writing. I often feel that I go off on tangents and try to make other points that are not significant in supporting my thesis. Sometimes I think I don't have enough supporting evidence that can be grouped into a clean correlated paragraph. As I said I have a much better organization process than I had before; however, I feel that if I was to dig up more information that pertains to major points in my writing that I would be able to keep my thoughts more precise. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ayane Hasegawa ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on grammar and vocabulary since I am an international student from Japan and I am not fluent in English. I have a tough time to write an academic paper and formal email since even though I have a solid idea or a concept to write, it is hard to translate my thoughts into English. I am trying to think in English when I come up with ideas to overcome the language barrier, but it is not easy and takes a lot of effort and time. In addition, I am facing the difficulties to understand American slang. I have never learned American slang in Japan since it is not included in Japanese formal English education. I learned much slang through the conversation with my friends in Geneseo but there are enormous American slang expression and using slang in academic writing is not appropriate. Therefore, I always have to be careful of the word choice because degerming which words are proper for an academic paper and formal email is hard, but it is oblivious for English speaker. For example, when I took a writing class for international students in Geneseo, I wrote "tons of problems" because I thought I should use a different expression of "a lot of" to avoid being repetitive. I would get an excellent great by using various vocabularies I learned from my roommate, however, when the professor returned the paper, she told me not to use slang and gave me B. I did not even realize that I used slang since I could not tell the difference between slang and formal words. Since then, I always make sure to know the vocabulary I learned from my friends is American slang or not to clarify the proper usage of the words. I do not have the self-confidence of my English skill, and I am uncomfortable to talk and write to the people who I am not close with. I would like to develop my English skill to overcome the language barrier to have more confidence in writing an academic paper. Since I did not have many experiences to write an essay in my home country, I would like to practice to be used to write in English through INTD courses at Geneseo. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Samantha Harris ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Samantha Harris []{.Apple-tab-span} When I am writing, I focus on gathering enough evidence to support the claim that I am trying to make. I can not prove my argument if I do not have enough supporting details to convince my audience. Before I start a body paragraph, I sometimes make an outline with a topic sentence, my main point of that paragraph and all of my supporting points. That way, I can make sure I include all of the necessary points that I have gathered from my sources. In terms of this aspect of writing, teachers in the past have told me that I must go into more detail and include more supporting evidence, and I believe that I have improved this over time and that it is now a strong point of my writing. []{.Apple-tab-span} An example of when I edited my essay to include more details and evidence is in my last sociology paper.

I also try to make sure that all my topic sentences for each paragraph tell what the paragraph will be about. My English teacher in ninth grade made me memorize the paragraph template, so every time I go to revise my drafts, I make sure my paragraphs match the template. This increases the fluidity of my paragraphs by having more connections. An example would be how I would originally have two sentences next to each other, like this: "Lizzy's mistress threatened to have her daughter taken away from her and sold at a slave auction. In the story, a little slave girl named Nancy, was being followed around, groped, and catcalled by a much older man". These two ideas have no connectors, so they seem like they don't belong in the same paragraph. When I went to revise this paper, I introduced a middle sentence to help the main idea of the paragraph shift to another point. I would include "Cather also wrote about sexual harassment to slaves". Now, those three sentences are tied together, and therefore, they sound better and have fluidity. As I continue to pursue my English education, I want to improve on all aspects of my writing. I don't want to be a writer who is good because I have good structure, or because I can paint a picture with my words. I want to be a writer who is good because every aspect of my writing is working together to make my drafts good and efficient at getting points across to readers. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kayla Grosso ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing, I often times focus on making sure I use the same tense throughout the whole essay. I find that I sometimes use the past and present tense in the same sentence. This concept is something my high school English teacher focused on, since many of us did it regularly in writing. While changing tense can sometimes be acceptable, I manage to shift from the present to the past in the same sentence, or when talking about the same topic. For example, "The Mayan people were astronomers, mathematicians, architects, sculptors, and fierce warriors. Their cities are made of stone and contained hundreds of pyramids." In the first sentence I used past tense, and in the next sentence I started off in the present tense then switched to the past. A second example of this is "People add nitric oxide to the atmosphere as they burned fuels at high temperatures, like in cars and jets. This gas is converted to nitrogen dioxide gas and nitric acid vapor which falls to the earth as acid deposition or acid rain." My first sentence started in the present (add) and shifted to the past (burned). My second sentence however is correct. It is important to be cautious when shifting tense as it could confuse the reader. It also can sometimes be grammatically incorrect. This can be avoided by proofreading not once, but twice. As my writing develops at Geneseo, I hope to focus on creating longer, more meaningful sentences. I think my sentences are sometimes too short, and don't contain enough detail. Sometimes when reading my writing I feel as though my sentences are fragmented, and the writing doesn't flow. In the future I could elaborate more on things I write. I could also find a way to relate shorter sentences and combine them. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Valerie Groccia ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Valerie Groccia INTD 106 2/4/19 In my writing I try to focus a lot on the organization of my essays, it\'s imperative to have a piece of writing be cohesive as well as engaging. When I was younger, I was always taught that writing is like building a house. Just like an architect, I begin with an outline or a blueprint for my "house." Having an outline allows me to breakdown each individual aspect of my thoughts into an ordered fashion. When my thoughts are organized onto paper, I then translate them onto my computer where I can elaborate on those thoughts and start building my "house. "An example of this process was in my college essay, in order to be concise and organized I worked especially hard on the order in which I placed my paragraphs. Initially, when I first started to draft my college essay I didn\'t want to play around with the order of my essay, I was nervous to step out of my comfort zone and try to change up the traditional template: topic sentence, three body paragraphs and a conclusion. In the beginning, my college essay consisted of me telling the audience why dance had been such a huge aspect in my life, which was a very generic and safe approach. Thereafter numerous revisions, I noticed that what I was saying didn't correspond with my trusted template, so I changed it up. I started my essay with a more immersive approach, for instance my new introduction: "I was performing my solo in front of my ballet teacher as she watched intently while I danced to Don Quixote's ballet variation of Kitri..." * *using this as my topic sentence it changed up my whole essay organization to be more interactive and engaging. Which I then was able to work off of that experience first and then have everything branch off of it. In the future, I'm hoping to improve my grammar and punctuation. I completely recognize how important it is to not only have a well-organized paper but to have a paper with little to no grammar mistakes. This has always been a concern of mine and I\'m very motivated to improve my writing along with my overall confidence level with writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tyler Green ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my previous works I have received positive feedback on a few aspects of my writing. Personally I believe that my best trait of the few is how well I can articulate and relate back to the main focus of my essay. This element is hard to find examples for because you either have the sentence relating back to the thesis statement or you do not have it for example at the beginning of one of my paragraphs instead of jumping right into the next point of my argument I often relate it back to the thesis so the reader does not get lost in the transition from one idea or the next. It often goes something like this, \"When talking about referring to stand your ground laws and similar topic such as police brutality it is nearly impossible to not involve that Trayvon Martin case, this paved the way for the laws as we see them today.\" Without relating it back to the main topic being stand your ground laws the readers can easily be lost in transition from the previous paragraph \"stand your ground laws give you to right to defend yourself if you at all feel threatened.\" and jump right to \"Trayvon Martin was shot and killed in the streets of Florida.\" A large chunk of this writing style was adopted from a high school teacher that I was taught by. In the future I would like to focus more on how and when to use certain punctuation and use more quotations from different pieces to support my argument. Too often I try very hard to get my point across and argue my side that I forget that I can sit back and let other authors and their works do the arguing for me. This not only would make it easier on me but also using weak arguments as counterclaims would only make my work seem more reliable and understandable. It would help me become a much better writer and help me understand other peoples works on a deeper level if I can improve on this skill. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ethan Gould ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Ethan Gould]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD-106-01: Conventions of College Writing]{style="font-weight: 400;"} Dr.[ Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[As I have gone through my academic career I've learned many different tips and aspects of writing that are both important and necessary in creating a sophisticated, professional piece of writing. These aspects have significantly bettered my writing abilities especially when taking into consideration the fact that I have never been the most gifted writer. One part of writing in particular that has aided me in becoming a better writer is organizing all of my ideas in my introductory paragraph to match them with each one of my body paragraphs. In the past I would normally write a generic introduction and then make whatever points I had in separate paragraphs respectively. The reason this was a necessary change that I needed to make is that when all of my ideas are organized in my introduction the reader immediately knows what topics will be addressed and I can then elaborate on each point in their own body paragraphs. This also notably strengthened my introductions for my written works. This is a skill that I put to use in my final paper for an English class that I enrolled in last semester. I made points such as; "Technology can also be helpful to the reader in determining the time period of the novel if it is not explicitly stated." and, "Another important aspect about technology in graphic novels is its ability to make the story work in almost any situation.". I later went on to give each of these points they're own paragraphs.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Something that I would like to develop as I continue writing is the ability to successfully and effortlessly transition between my ideas. This is something that I have always struggled with and always seems to find its way onto my paper in the form of notes written by my teachers and professors. I could have the greatest ideas to share in my work but I can never quite gracefully transition from one idea to another, making my works seem choppy and unorganized.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lara Goodman ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I revise my drafts, I consciously look for lack of transition as well as cohesiveness. I have been told that I tend to just write all of my thoughts without a cogent theme throughout. A writing center student had explained to me that due to my lack of cohesion I should organize my writing on paper, with a clear thesis before even starting the paper. I was told I that my writing is good, however the lack of organization damages the integrity of what am writing about. This skill is important because it helps strengthen the argument further by providing more facts(logos) in an organized manner. When facts and theses are disorganized it creates a feeling of disillusion within the reader because they cannot form full thoughts when there is no clear direction. An example of a disorganized sentence would be "Green revolution era technologies such as these had led to a more effective crop output, leading to higher crop yields". An improved sentence would be " Higher crop yields are due to green revolution era technologies such as these". The sentence leads the reader by getting straight to the point of higher crop yields instead of dawdling on the restatement of the prior claim. This strategy keeps the reader engaged and focused on the topic at hand. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In moving through my academic career at Geneseo, I aim to consolidate my writing to create more powerful arguments. I am aware of my issues in transitions, as well as idea consolidation, and I believe that developing combative strategies to reduce these errors would be immensely powerful. In the future, a possible solution is reading everything out loud, and when creating an outline put transitional devices automatically in as a reminder to utilize them.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brigid Goodman ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I focus on is using evidence to support my claims. I think throughout my high school career, finding and using evidence when writing a paper was heavily stressed. Every teacher ingrained in me the importance of not only to have a point but to prove it with textual evidence from novels or from academic articles. History class was chock full of Document Based Questions, in which students had to make arguments almost completely based off evidence from the given documents. I've also learned a lot about using evidence here at Geneseo. I had to write a research paper for an environmental class I was taking. The paper required evidence from two academic articles. I used the databases on the Milne library page, this ensured that my sources were in fact academic. I have many issues in my writing. My papers can be very unorganized, sometimes halfway through writing a paper, I find that I have aimlessly wandered away from my thesis. I also tend to struggle with grammar, specifically when to use a comma (I'm not sure if I used that comma correctly). I even sometimes write in fragments unknowingly. I really hope that I can strengthen my foundation in writing so I can express my thoughts more eloquently and creatively. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ralph Gomez ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my academic writing I already focus on trying to improve is my delivery. When I write in essays, I tend to sound wordy or awkward. I believe the reason I sound like this is because I've kept the same mindset of writing high school papers in which I would write in a sequence of topic sentence, context, evidence, analysis, analysis, conclusion. Since I didn't feel as passionate about the topic I was writing about, I would bore the readers out with saying "also" repeatedly coming up with any analysis I can think of. With trying to over analyze my pieces of evidence, I ultimately started to have variations of sentences with the same meaning. An example is within an essay arguing about unequal education in lower income neighborhoods, I stated, "with minorities not being in school due to suspensions and expulsions, it makes them lose out on education that they could be receiving. Also with students not being in class and eventually coming back, they are stuck in a position of being behind of all other students throughout their whole school year." The two sentences could have been summed within one sentence. Having those two sentences, I feel like they only gave the reader much more to read and possibly get confused with. A proper way I could have combined them would be by saying, "With minorities not being in school due to suspensions and expulsions, it makes them stay in a position where they are behind all other students and possibly have to repeat classes, let alone the grade."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect I want to develop effectively writing in Geneseo is writing in a concise manner. I feel as though saying the same thing over and over only makes my writing sound repetitive and boring. Being able to say things effectively in a efficient way would be easier for readers to clearly understand what my argument is and how I support it. I believe there is a limit to analyzing quotes, let alone one's reasoning for their argument thus creating filler all throughout their paper which I want to eliminate. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joseph Gomez ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Joseph Gomez]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Gillian Paku ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/9/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} **Writing Reflection** [When writing, I focus on the evidence I use to strengthen my argument because I believe that the main part of an essay or argument is the evidence that you can use to back it up. An essay without evidence or reasoning is like a burger without the patty, it's no longer considered a burger. Most of my arguments or claims are built by what type of evidence I can find for it and whether it is strong and reliable or not. All evidence used to backup up claims should come from a reliable source because anyone can say what they want but only some can prove what they're saying is correct. An example of this would include my latest research paper I did for my summer INTD course on food consumption vs food distribution around the world. One piece of evidence I used said "half of the food America has wasted yearly is due to the fact that we choose not to distribute it." which can be questioned because there are no stats or numbers to support this evidence. So then my professor and I revised it and found a new piece of evidence which stated, "Lack of Nutritious food would explain why 738 Latinos completed the survey. 241 (32.7 %) participants were obese (BMI \> 30 kg/m) and 302 (41 %) individuals were overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m)." Not only is this evidence more focused on a particular group of people, it's also providing data to back up the claims of poor food distribution, which makes people believe it more and actually think twice about the topic.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect I want to develop effectively here at Geneseo is my thesis and how worldwide it should be. I feel like that's where my main weakness is which brings down my writing as an author because it lacks the drive to keep others focused and intrigued in what I am writing. I shift more of my focus on my evidence because I care heavily about it which makes me put minimal effort on my thesis. Going forward I hope once I am done with this class my writing would have improved drastically. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Giugliano =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Something that I learned that made me a better writer would have to be the use of rhetorical appeals. The three rhetorical appeals are ethos, logos and pathos. The one I tend to use the most is pathos in my writing to appeal to the audience's emotions to further my argument or writing. In a general sense everyone believes themselves as "good people" so you put something in that only has one right answer, so they believe it to be an absolute justification to your reasoning. I would say something like, "If you had an opportunity to save a friends life or have a million dollars, what would you choose?", I think we can all agree on the fact that we would save our friends rather than take the money. Pathos is an element we see in everyday writing, news, and even in our videogames. This is a technique used to grasp at our humanity, morals, and emotions to keep us engaged and sway us to a certain side or to help us relate to what the author is saying. Of course, there are the other rhetorics as well and although I am not as versed in those as I am in pathos, I hope to better my abilities in them for future uses. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jean Gillman ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} #### [I focus mostly on keeping my audience interested in the introduction to my writings because I want the audience to be attentive and absorbed in my essays. If the readers find your essays boring they tune out your works. As teachers are the ones who mostly read my writings I want to stand out from the other kids in my classes. In my high school English class, senior year, my teacher wanted us to get used to making your reader want to read on. He said that they have no reason to keep reading unless you give them one, because of this I try really hard to make my writings seem interesting. An example of this is when I wrote an essay talking about impression management, how one uses communication to influence others, I wrote: "From mother to sister to friend to foe, the way you display yourself can change." I then connect this rather broad but interesting statement to the point I\'m trying to prove; "We change our presented self based on how we wish to be perceived. Just by writing introductions to two different people the presented self changes immensely."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} #### [Moving forward with my writing, I would like to improve my grammar. I have had a very hard time understanding the rules of grammar because I was pulled out of English classes to participate in reading and speech comprehension classes. When I was diagnosed with dyslexia I knew I would have to try a lot harder to succeed in writing. I feel uncomfortable relying on my grammar skills and usually use sites like Grammarly to fix my mistakes. I hope to learn more about grammar and slowly improve.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brady George ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When tasked with writing, one thing I heavily focus on is my use of differing sentence structure and transitional words. In high school my writing, no matter how thought-provoking or planned out it may have been, was dull due to my constant use of the same sentence styles and words. An example is the phrase "This shows..." which I would begin multiple sentences in a single paragraph with. Using the same clause to begin many sentences in a row leads to a feeling that a reader would be reading a list as opposed to a well-planned paper. An english teacher I had in my eleventh year of high school pointed this out to me in a few of my papers, and since then I have actively worked in an effort to make this error as little as possible. I have switched from saying "There has been a 50% decrease in profits related to development of original video game titles. This shows a lack of interest in the subject. This shows that the field is no longer a viable option for up-and-coming investors." to "There has been a 50% decrease in profits related to development of original video game titles. This demonstrates a lack of interest in the subject, and contributes to the decreasing viability of this field in the minds of investors." This not only makes the thoughts more concise and less clunky, but increases the readability of the writing and presents the information in a more engaging way. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One area of writing that I would like to improve upon is in my use of quoted material. Often times in my writing I tend to have paragraphs with more words from other authors than myself. I have frequently mentioned multiple quotes in a single paragraph, only vaguely stringing them together. I did this under the guise of letting them "speak from themselves", however upon further inspection this practice only makes my papers and essays less connected and explained. A fix to this dilemma could be more critically analyzing information brought up in quotes before adding other cited material to the paper. This would likely allow for smoother connections between the authors' respective ideas and my own.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Maggie Geiger =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} ** 1.** I am fully aware that my writing is not perfect. However, there are aspects of writing at which I excel, including, to put it simply, answering the question. Whether it be a thematic essay, an argumentative essay, or even a simple paragraph, I am able to focus on the task at hand. Even if I stray from the main point, I can always tie what I am saying back to the purpose. I used to struggle with this a lot throughout high school. Every assignment that I was given, I approached listlessly. I was so overconfident in my ability to write that, although what I handed in was crafted beautifully, I never received full credit in regard to completely developing an argument or having enough actual evidence to support my claims.[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"134233279":true,"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} Once I was able to realize my mistakes, I changed the way I wrote academically. I reference the prompt numerous times while writing, making sure I remain on topic. I plan my essays beforehand; I am extremely thorough when constructing an outline. For example, last semester I had to write a 1500-word paper on any environmental issue of my choosing. I chose the effects of Agent Orange (a toxic defoliant used by American forces during the Vietnam war) on the Vietnamese environment and people. Before I started typing, I wrote out a template on paper for myself. I listed my citations in proper format and numbered them, then proceeded to plan the entire essay. I mapped out each paragraph, assigning each one an overarching topic, an introduction and conclusion sentence, and all of the details in between. The first bullet in the introduction portion of my outline simply states: "Highlight ferocity of Vietnam War." My final draft stated: "The Vietnam War was accompanied by barbarous bloodshed and countless casualties on both sides and is not regularly associated with environmental issues. However, there existed multiple variables that, in some manner, contributed a form of long-term change." Every piece of information that I took from another source had the source number written next to it. This allowed me to write the essay and stay on topic with ease.[ ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559685":720,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"} [** 2.** ]{data-ccp-props="{"201341983":0,"335559685":720,"335559731":720,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}"}I would like to develop my sentence structure. I tend to be so incredibly verbose and I overuse complex and compound-complex sentences. Reading what I write can be very exhausting and overcomplicated.

I need to work on having thesis statements be a balance of a preview of my paper but also not being too long or wordy. In my college essay, it was really a challenge to do all of this while still being concise and interesting. College essays are really hard because you have limited space to talk about what you want, but you have to be really interesting to captivate an audience that has to read thousands of essays in a small time.

Literary devices can range anywhere from similes, metaphors, imagery, personification and many more. While I was writing my college essay, my English teacher at the time advised me to add more imagery to my essay. She told me to "make the reader feel like they're in your position". From that point on I began to revise my college essay and add as much imagery as I could. My essay was about my volunteer work at a local nursing home, so I tried to add as much detail about the setting and the people as I could. Imagery was the literary device that worked best in my college essay, but metaphors and similes are also great literary devices to use. In my college essay I described a resident at the nursing home by writing, "Sitting in a wheelchair with a blanket wrapped around her even in July, she was a tiny figure, wearing every piece of jewelry she owned", hoping the reader would get a better image of the small woman that spoke to me later that day. I also wrote a paper on adolescent development and the types of parenting and sometimes the best way to describe a situation was to use a simile or metaphor that anyone is could relate to.

Fluency helps the reader process my information and get my point across accurately. Whether my essay is research or opinion based it is extremely important that the facts and information included throughout my writing are correct.

In my high school AP English classes I found that these skills were my strong points and very important aspects of my writing to achieve my point and write fluent accurate papers. Throughout my years in high school English classes I have improved my writing based on reading well known books and having peer editing sessions with my classmates and teachers. In comparing my writing to others and well-known authors I have realized I have a lot of room to grow and have improved my skills immensely. Other authors have inspired and taught me there are different ways to intrigue your audience, portray your point, and provide evidence that can create an impressive and well-shaped piece for your audience to read and enjoy. One of the main inspirations I've had is from F. Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald is a well loved famous American author who shaped literature in such a fluent, organized, and intriguing way.

I understand as a writer not to drag out my writing but how to make it sound clean, crisp, and concise. I believe this aspect of writing was first introduced to me in English class via Ernest Hemingway's ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Sun Also Rises.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ I discovered that Hemingway would edit drafts several times over, "trimming the fat" of excess words. I believe this is important in all kinds of writing because it keeps the reader focused on the main purpose of the piece.

When asked if everything Shapiro says can be taken at face value Tory responded with, "Yes, that's not even an opinion" (Steinroeder 2018). Tory, like much of Shapiro's audience, views him as an intellect who is never wrong and never concedes." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Overall as a writer, I would like to improve my skills in formatting and writing in a more academic style.

I have a tendency to stop writing if I feel that my piece is too long. My English teacher last year, during my Syracuse University Project Advance writing course, taught me that when I state my ideas or claims I should ask "so what?" afterwards. I start out with bullet points in my outline and answer "so what?" in a vague manner. Then, in every draft leading up to the final draft I keep asking myself "so what?". This way I can make sure that I have thoroughly explained what I am trying to say to the reader. For example, in one of my classes last semester, one of my claims for an essay about if force, coercion, or violence are ever justifiable was that "in theory force and violence can be justified." Then, by asking "so what" I moved on to explain "In theory, violence should only necessary when there is a just reason. Like a violation of human rights." In my next draft, I realized this was not answering "so what" to is force ever justified, so I restated it to, "Violence should only be necessary when there is a just reason. A good case for when to use violence or when to go to war is a violation of human rights. People believe that their governments or the people in charge will do the right thing, but the '"right thing" is subjective." This semester I would like to work on how to transition into a conclusion. I feel that when I try to write one, it usually comes out awkward and doesn't flow well with the rest of my writing. I would like the improve on this skill because if a conclusion isn't well written, then my writing doesn't end on a good note. Maybe I could use templates and find something that works for me, so that I can put together a better conclusion. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jonathan Stypa ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on making sure that the key and important parts of my thesis are worked into my essay and making sure that they relate back to the thesis. If a term is used in my thesis, I make sure that I can refer to it in each of my paragraphs. This is important to reinforce the key terms/argument of the essay. I have gotten help with developing this skill all throughout my four years of high school, teachers have helped me individually and with handouts, they have given me. An example would be going from a vague explanation like "The white folks made times hard for Zora", but when thinking how I could relate my explanation back to my thesis, "The white kids are oppressing Zora with the amount of hate that they are giving her for the color of her skin, also for the background of her ancestors.". I like to make sure that my explanation of a quote fully relates back to my thesis to make sure that my idea is reinforced. I never used to do this leaving my explanation vague and dry, without a quality explanation leading back to the thesis statement my ideas don't have the context to them and don't work well into my essay. With really working on this I believe that my essays have become much better, being able to fully develop and explain quotations is key to a good essay. Going forward, I would like to focus more on my punctuation in my essays. I find that I am always using run-on sentences, and not using punctuation when I should be using it. Punctuation is one the biggest part of writing an essay, without it the essay is no good. Focusing on making sure that I am using the correct punctuation when writing is something I must focus on more. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Strong ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} <div> One aspect of academic writing that I currently focus on is contractions, such as can't versus cannot, don't versus do not, and haven't versus have not. When I was in elementary school, my English teacher at the time had us write a mock-up of a letter we would eventually send to a real company or business. We were supposed to state something we liked or did not like about said company and their products/services. The biggest takeaway that I had from that exercise was the proper usage of contractions when writing a formal letter. When I went off to college, I found myself writing very formal emails to people I had never met before. This once again brought up the idea of formal and informal contractions in my writing. For example, in the last email I wrote to my boss, I said, \"I have not received the email with my hours for the first week of the spring semester". At first, I had written "I haven't received", but I then backtracked after I remembered that this was in fact, going to my boss. Although I did not realize it at the time, that one English assignment in elementary school helped me learn a lot about my formal writing. However, there are still some characteristics in my writing that I would like to work on. One such aspect is my employment of commas. I feel as though I use many commas in my writing and sometimes, I am not even sure if I am using them correctly. Hopefully I can work on this throughout my time at Geneseo, as well as continue to remember my proper contractions. </div> ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jake Storey ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Jake Storey 2/8/19 [ When writing, I focus heavily on backing up my assertions, or assertions made by authors for which I'm citing, with explanations and convincing logical rationale. Throughout high school, my English teachers have provided me with writing templates. Not all templates were the same, but generally they stated that within each body paragraph of an argumentative or academic writing piece you should argue for a claim, then provide facts or scholarly arguments, and, finally, insert your own voice in order to explain your interpretation of the aforementioned cited piece. This process was particularly enforced in me by my tenth grade English instructor, who stressed the importance of following an outlined format when writing academic pieces, and who would occasionally penalize me for not following an obviously structured and organized writing system. One of my writing pieces that demonstrates this strength of mine effectively is an argumentative paper discussing capital punishment. In the piece, I argued against the practice. My strongest claim came from the fact that it costs much more to enact capital punishment practices than it does to house prisoners for life-long terms. In each paragraph, I stated a sub-claim that would ultimately support my central claim, which was that the practice of capital punishment should be abolished. I gave factual evidence to back up my sub-claim, and followed this up with my own voice in an effort to appeal logically to my reader. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ An aspect of my writing that I'm looking to improve upon is my superfluous use of language. At times, I can be too wordy and reiterate points more than necessary. I'm a math major, and while I recognize that one should take a very different mentality into writing an academic paper as opposed to a mathematical proof, I think my writing in general could afford to be more concise.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Stock ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Throughout my writing, I must continuously pay close attention to the tense in which I am communicating. There have been a variety of different occasions when I have been told to revisit a section of my work, for I have utilized the wrong tense. This detail is essential to any piece of writing, because switching between tenses too often can confuse the reader. Any strong paper can be quickly destroyed by this one fatal mistake.\ Although my high school teachers would always correct this issue, I would still find myself slipping back into my old habit quite frequently. During a recent peer review, a student once again brought up a section of my essay where I had used the past tense instead of present. The preset tense was required in this situation however, because I was writing about a piece of literature. The rest of the essay was in the correct tense, but my mind had slipped back into its old ways for just one sentence. I wrote, "They felt dejected and confused, and wanted the discrimination to be put to an end," when I should have written, "They feel dejected and confused, and want discrimination to be put to an end."\ While this doesn't appear to be a devastating thing to happen in a paper, it is never acceptable to confuse you reader over a fixable mistake. I am continuously working on this habit, and finding new ways to improve. I make sure to proofread multiple times in order to catch these errors. Fixing my mistakes and learning form them is consistently helping me to grow as a writer. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Rebekka Stewart ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Rebekka Stewart ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/8/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ [ When I write any type of paper of essay, I focus on the details and description, which allows the reader to create an image in their mind about the writing. Being able to picture what you are reading is a key aspect to understanding and enjoying the piece. In high school, my English teachers would be persistent in telling my class and I how important details were when attempting to keep the writing interesting and draw in the reader, as well as to enhance the point you are trying to make or the story you are telling. For instance, I could change an undescriptive statement such as "Another cap expressing my friend's admiration for science and her excitement to begin at a new school" to "My friend's navy blue graduation cap was decorated quite simply, with the name of the college she would attend, Ithaca College, spelled out in petite gold letters, as well as the year she would graduate, 2022, also spelled out in the same gold letters. Her graduation cap also included a small paper tree in the center of the cap, in order to portray her admiration for science." The latter statement would allow the reader to imagine the cap much more vividly. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ In the future, I would like to expand my amount of discussion after providing a quote or an example. I believe I have trouble getting straight to the point when trying to explain how the quote directly relates to and supports my thesis. I could possibly focus on the correlation between the example and my thesis more directly, rather than circling around it. This would allow the reader to follow my explanation more clearly and understand the correlation better. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tory Steinroeder ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Tory Steinroeder]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When I start an essay, I tend to put a lot of detail into the points I try to make when it comes to supporting or refuting an argument. I tend to attack arguments or topics from many different angles and this usually leads to a plethora of information. After I have written the draft for the first time, I usually go back and reread the many points I have made and decide whether or not that point has proven my argument or whether it\'s just starting to take up space on the page. I also know that I\'m a very indecisive person, so I tend to edit and rewrite many drafts before I find exactly what I\'m looking for. For example, one of last essays I wrote was about the social stratification in ancient Mesoamerica. I found an overwhelming amount of information about how the different class levels were affected by the state, but my only issue was how I could fit a large portion of that material into my argument without watering it down. It actually took me 4 different drafts and in the end I chose just to mention evidence of this in the major civilizations, including the Aztecs, Maya, and the Olmec. In the end, my professor celebrated me for my precision, but also showed discontent for the length of time I took to perfect it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [What I hope to improve upon is consolidating the research I do for my writing. What often happens is that I spend a lot of time researching key points of an argument, but I then get stuck later trying to find a way to choose exactly what I want to include in my essay and it sometimes can cause some inconsistency in my arguments. I often find that because of this, it makes me feel less confident when it comes to writing an essay because I\'m afraid I\'ll go through this same issue again. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Owen Stein ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One of the most important aspects I focus on when revising my drafts must have to be spelling. Spelling is a key aspect in revising because without the correct spelling of words, your essay makes no sense at all. I would say classify myself as an excellent speller, regardless of things such as spellcheck. Spellcheck may be an excellent, hands free tool when it comes to typing in word documents. But if a writing excerpt must written by hand, spelling absolutely crucial. While typing an essay may seem extremely easy to do, the spelling of hand-written essays are something many people tend to overlook and forget about. During the revising process, spellcheck may correct most of errors in my writing, but it doesn't hit all of them. My basic revising process involves constantly revising and relooking at the things I am typing. For example, if I were to write a paragraph for my resume, I would normally write a sentence. After doing that, I would go back and double check that sentence I have written to make sure everything is spelled correctly and that the sentence makes sense. I continue to do this for every sentence I write there on until I finish the said paragraph. Once my paragraph is completed and all my sentences are checked twice, I go back again a third time through all the sentences to verify all my corrections were valid and correct. It is a pretty basic process and doesn't take that long to learn. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward throughout my years at Geneseo, I would like to improve the overall flow of my writing. While my spelling may be correct, my sentences may often seem very choppy and they don't have much rhythm to them. Improving the flow of and coherency of my writing would greatly boost my writing skills, and it is a skill I have been attempting to improve but I cannot just seem to do so.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Owen Stevens ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Owen Stevens Intd 106 Reflection Essay 5^th^ February 2019 Most of the writing that I've done or will do has been based around delivering comprehensive and thought out conversations. More specifically, the field of History requires me to write with a great deal of consideration and empathy, and above all skepticism. Writing in a way that allows the reader to contextualize and draw their own conclusions based on the facts or dilemmas discussed. My writing was not always so purposeful. In fact, I have received quite a bit of critique on my writing. Before I really began to correct my approach, I was writing simply to broadcast to the teacher or the professor that I knew the curriculum taught to us, and that reflected in my writing. Instead of developing a cohesive and coherent argument based on critical thinking about issues, I was merely describing events and facts and a very one-sided style of writing. Before I changed my approach, my thesis might look something like this; "The peoples of the medieval Mediterranean were brought together by trade, diplomacy, but above all travel". While this is a true statement, it gives no real argument or dilemma to be proved or discussed. This thesis then turned into something like this; "The peoples of the medieval Mediterranean were integrated through many things, including trade, diplomacy, and travel. However, many things occurred which severely limited the ability to interact with foreign nations, such as the fall of the Roman Empire, and the growing threat of Muslim power east of the Mediterranean". This shift in my writing has allowed me to develop as first a thinker, and an organizer, and lastly a good writer. One aspect of my writing I would like to develop is my efficiency and knowledge in grammar and in the more technical aspects of writing, including proper grammar and punctuation. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Melissa Stein =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} A problem I have when writing essays, emails, letters, etc. is writing about something in 200 words when it can be written by someone else in 100 words and still get the same point across. Generally, when a teacher grades a paper of mine, there are usually crosses through many of my sentences. For example, my college admissions essay was extremely difficult for me to write. There was a specific word limit and every time I tried to write my essay, I would be extremely over the maximum word count. My teacher helped me revise it after I had tried multiple times. After this experience, I have tried to condense my sentences to avoid exceeding the word limit. Additionally, I will re-read my essay and take out sentences that I think might be unnecessary. Then, I re-read it without the sentences and see if my essay still makes sense. If it does, I keep the essay the way it is and if it sounds the same, I will take those sentences out. Working on this skill is important because run on sentences can ruin the quality of an essay and in terms of writing emails, run on sentences make them unnecessarily long and this wastes time for the receiver and me. A new skill I would like to work on is writing in a more sophisticated manner. When I read my essays compared to those of my fellow classmates, I sometimes feel as if their essays are better, solely based on the higher level of words used and the way in which the essay is written. To improve my vocabulary, I can look up a new word every day and/or use a thesaurus when I feel that there are better words that can be used. Expanding my vocabulary is important because it will help my communication skills as well. If I said \"I have a lot of homework\" and replaced it with \"I have an ample amount of homework\", I already sound more sophisticated. I hope that throughout this course and my INTD 105 course, I will be able to learn new skills to enhance my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Noah Smith ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing I focus most on making sure that my essay's and regular writing responses have a consistent message that I don't stray away from. This is an important skill because, when writing you should always try to tell the person reading what you're trying to communicate in the most concise and simplest way possible. I have been able to enhance this skill through the help of former teachers that I had back in high school. This skill really came in handy when I was writing my college essay, in my first couple drafts of the essay I wrote a long random essay. It had many unnecessary unimportant points including the details of the trip on the way to the performance the essay was about as well as what my family and I had got to eat when we were there. Because of these excess of unimportant sentences my essay continuously was over the word limit. My English teacher was able to show me what I was doing wrong she showed me that by getting rid of the irrelevant sentences in my essay I wouldn't just be able to stay under the word limit I also would be writing a better essay as well. I feel like keeping a consistent message while writing is a very important skill for everyone to learn as the quality of your work is always more important than its quantity. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An area in my writing that could use some improvement is my ability to explain quotes. When I'm writing longer essays I sometimes get lazy and don't backup why I'm using certain quotes I just set up the quote and put it in with no real context. I know if I just take my time and reread my essays I will be able to correct this problem.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Meghan Sheridan ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In high school, I was taught how to structure and write my essays and papers. This is something I feel I have learned to do very well, and it has strengthened my writing greatly. Writing introductions have always been easy for me. My teachers always taught us a specific structure for them, which helped shape the rest of the essay. For example, I would start with a strong thematic sentence and then add two more general statements about the body paragraphs I would be writing about. After that, I would usually just tie up my introduction with another thematic sentence. I used an example of this technique in the following essay, "The opening shot of a movie is often discussed as the most important scene of the entire film, it can present to the audience the mood, the tone, the setting, the main character, and setup the message of the film. If there was a comparison to be given between the opening shot and humans, it would most succinctly be described as the first word spoken. Just as a humans first words might seem meaningless at first, a short second that, in the greater span of that person's life may seem miniscule, like a grain of sand on a beach, but when put into the that person's life, suddenly those first words begin to encompass and encapsulate that person's life." I like to plan out my writing and outline before starting a paper to ensure an orderly and precise introduction. I like to rely less on spur of the moment writing and prefer more planned out strategies. Something I would like to work on in my writing is my prose. I feel like I always have a good structure for my essay and know what I want to say but can never get the right words down on paper. Sometimes I focus too much on the structural part of the paper rather than picking good words to use in it. Creativity is hard for me with writing, especially when it comes to a research or even college paper, because I like to focus more on the factual side of things. I focus more on the information instead of using my own voice. Strengthening my use of words and how they are conveyed in my writing would help allow me to have strong writing for the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexander Seram ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of concern that I encounter in my writing is my word choice. I try to have my writing follow a flow but the way I write becomes broad and too explicit, this throws off that flow. One major way of how I disrupt that flow is the usage of elaborate terms. I started to encounter these problems in my senior year of high school when I had assignments in English class that required a higher level of thinking and interpretation. I came out of my junior year with this habit because I was one of those individuals who thought it would make my writing seem more interesting if I put in elaborate terms. I learnt about my little downfall when my senior year high school English teacher gave everyone a prompt to write and then gave feedback on the writing style of each individual. The feedback entailed my mistakes and from that day I try to limit myself and improve my writing. One specific example is from a paper I wrote for a Biology experiment: [\"In the end the experiment was carried out flawlessly but I think that it was also limited. The restriction to only the bench press was limiting to the data that was collected according to the output of repetitions from each individual. One thing that would make this experiment better would be the introduction of multiple exercises such as squats and deadlifts along with the bench press. With this the correlation of the influence of BMI and muscle endurance can be tested on different exercises rather than being limited to one.\"]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[]{style="font-weight: 400;"} This was written as an initial conclusion but from realizing my mistakes I re-typed it as, \" In the end the experiment was carried out with ease but it had limitations to it. By restricting the data collection to repetitions of bench presses from each individual offers limiting data. One way to avoid that is to include multiple exercises including; squats, deadlifts and also the bench press. The BMI trend and muscle endurance hypothesis can be tested on multiple exercises rather than being tested on one.\". i replaced words such as \"flawless\" and \"restriction\" by removing words like these and replacing it with much simpler terms helped to create a better flow in the writing to create a reflection rather than a boast. The large words takes away the attention from the message in the writing, if the reader does not know what the word means it makes it harder to understand the message being conveyed. I need to learn to use those words and have the grammar correlate with the use because then the words can be used in ways that is correct and more easy to convey and comprehend As of today, I cannot claim to be a perfect writer. I still make those mistakes and many other more that I may not notice. Each of these mistakes creates flaws in my writing. Being in my freshman year at Geneseo I would love to be coached in writing to prevent myself from further making these mistakes. Being better prepared at writing is a critical point for my college career with the many years to come and the many writing assignments to come my way. I would like to fix my problem with exaggerated word choices by not avoiding it but by learning how and when it should be used in writing. I do believe that INTD 106 will definitely help me to fix my errors in writing and help me develop more skills along the way one step at a time. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Valentina Scotto ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When prompted with the task of identifying one aspect of academic writing that I already focus on intentionally, I noticed that I usually try and plan my essay out ahead of time. Throughout high school and middle school, this was a huge part of the essay process for me, teachers were always trying to promote this kind of organization in hopes that it would help me later on. When using this method of planning out, I separate each of my topics and ideas into their section, for example for the introduction I would separate the main ideas that I want to get across in the rest of my essay and make sure they are introduced in the introduction. When writing one of my response papers on \"Does Teacher Diversity Matter in Student Learning\" for INTD 203, U/Social Foundations of American Education I planned to start off talking about my own experiences with teacher diversity in the introduction, along with my thesis. I then decided that I would discuss how statistically true or false it is that gender and race matter and so on and so on, I concluded with my final thoughts and last arguments. I\'ve found that prepping my essay before I even try and write it down really helps solidify my ideas and helps me keep me on track, even if I simply write down a word, that will help me with word association later on. Therefore, whenever I have prepped for an essay or written a basic outline I have found that it helps me not only with that assignment but the others around me, it keeps me on track and allows me to fully focus on the work that needs to be done, limiting other distractions around me. One aspect that I would like to develop during my time here at SUNY Geneseo that will help me throughout my college experience and beyond would definitely have to be having my writing reflect more of a profession tone than a personal one. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katrina Saylor ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on my syntax when I am revising my drafts. I think that it is an important skill to have and I have worked hard on improving it throughout high school. It helps to get my point across in a clearer way and helps my reader to better understand what I am saying. Although my syntax may not be great at times, it is the skill that I focus most on when I am revising my drafts. An example that I have is in my application for a Resident Assistant. I initially said, \"If you see this, you should step in, like if you see them by themselves, talk to them, and if you see them sitting by themselves at dinner, invite them to sit with you.\" This sentence, while it may make some sense, it becomes clearer if I change the sentence to multiple sentences like \"If you see this, you should step in. [Make friends with that person who is being left out or who is sitting quietly. If you see them out by themselves at dinner, invite them to sit with you or ask to join them.\" Turning the one sentence into a few smaller sentences makes my point clearer and more concise.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} It is something that my high school teachers drilled in school. Syntax is an important element to have. especially going into big college papers. It elevates the writing and shows that I understand the importance of a skill like syntax. One writing skill that I want to develop effectively is language. I think that the language that is used is an important way to help to get the point across in writing. My language is okay, but I want to improve it and make it more sophisticated. i think that it will make my writing more mature and definitely help my writing be better understood. More sophisticated language makes writing more interesting and it makes people want to read more. Language does not just have to be larger words, it can be words that are strung together to help describe something in such a way that readers can create an image in their minds. I want the language that I use to help create new worlds for my readers to enter in to. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Leila Sassouni ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a student who proudly embarks on the continuation of her academic career, I have been given and continue to receive advice from various outlets, which each help guide me to become a stronger student and a better person. In my senior year of high school, I was writing my college essay and I had an abundance of trouble constructing complete, personal ideas. My AP Language and Composition teacher, who was helping me edit my essay, sat with me in a classroom and pinpointed specific lines in the essay that he felt were too weak and could have been strengthened by investing more of my emotions and passion. One line depicted the pain I felt shortly after getting a concussion, and the other conveyed my lonesomeness months after my diagnosis. From that conversation and my proceeding internalizations, I recognized the importance of finding passion in and engaging with my own pieces of writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As a college student now, I find myself more aware of when I am passionate about a piece I am writing, whether for a writing course or for Geneseo's school newspaper, The Lamron.

This year, I took the initiative to write for the Knights' Life Section of the Newspaper. One article I wrote dealt with toxic relationships, and the specific incidents in which an individual should recognize red flags. On account of my various experiences with unhealthy friendships and relationships, my thoughts flowed effortlessly in tune with the quotes I found from various trustworthy online sources. I tried to find concrete information and solid examples through several different outlets that I could then analyze for myself and write in depth about. My writing process for that article was strong, specifically because of how much information I tried to find and because of how much emotion I invested into the assignment. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [This year, as an avid participant in my different writing courses and my extra-curricular involvement, I have discovered, and am continuing to discover, the abundant happiness I feel when writing, editing, and reading literary works. At Geneseo, I want to work on challenging myself more in my writing so that I can become a stronger writer. I will carry my teacher's message with me and apply his advice to assignments and goals I hope to achieve. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Una Stopford ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I have taken many English classes over the past few years, and I like to think that they have allowed me to become a better writer. Up until recently, my writing had been very structured, and adhered to the guidelines you would find on a standardized test. I did not like how my writing would sound when following these guidelines. I always found that it was clunky, and did not flow very well at all. Despite this, I would do well on the essays and standardized tests because I gave them exactly what they were looking for, even if I knew it was not my best writing.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} [ ]{.Apple-tab-span}Last year I took AP Literature at my high school, and this was definitely the moment my writing changed dramatically. I remember getting our first writing prompt about the novel, The Canterbury Tales, and I also remember getting my paper back having received a very low grade on it. I was surprised until my teacher said it was expected for us to get a low grade on our first paper because of how we were told to write in every class before this. From that moment forward, my writing became something that wasn't just a filling out a template of sorts. While my teacher introduced a lot of new writing techniques, she specifically emphasized the use of insight, something that I had never used before in my writing. Insight has now become a tool that I use a lot while writing, and I find my writing to be too choppy and dry without it.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} [ ]{.Apple-tab-span}A specific example of how I began to use insight was when we read, The Sound and the Fury in class. We were instructed to write an essay about the character of Quentin, who through out his entire chapter, suffers from a variety of internal conflicts. While originally I would've written about what was actually stated in the text, such as how Quentin is depressed and suicidal, I opted to discuss how I believed Faulkner intended for Quentin to represent time as a concept. While by itself that is a very impulsive and rash statement, I was able to back it up with evidence from the text. The purpose of using insight for not only that specific essay, but all of my writing, is to write about something more than what was already clearly written in the novel. [ ]{.Apple-tab-span}One aspect of my writing that I have been trying to work on more lately but still need to improve upon is my vocabulary. Overall my vocabulary has remained stagnant since high school, and I know that my essays and papers would sound much more mature if I were to include higher-level vocabulary in them. I am hoping that through out this writing course, and down the line, I become better at choosing vocabulary that is appropriate for the level of writing that I am completing.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Edmonds =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing pieces for academic or recreational purposes I try to focus on fluency. I think that when reading what I have written out loud, the words should roll off the tongue smoothly and sentences should not be choppy. One example of working on the fluency of my sentences can be seen in an essay I wrote in high school. I began with, "By considering the state of present-day America, it is obvious that Mr. Banneker and people with the same ideologies were able to change the nation from one person owning another to working side by side." This is a mouthful and is not very specific regarding the topic. On the next draft I wrote, "From experiencing the American society today, one can see the change Mr. Banneker and similar minds were able to bring about. Instead of one man owning another, we have people working side by side.\" Here, I split up the sentence into two and also changed the wording to flow better but did not change the point. I decided on, "From experiencing the American society today, one can see the change Mr. Banneker and similar minds were able to bring about regarding the issue of race. Instead of one man owning another based on the color of their skin, we have people of all ethnic backgrounds working side by side."[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}I become much more precise in terms of the topic I am discussing and these sentences are more concise than one long one. I like to support my claims with evidence and quotations but am aware of how easy it is to accidentally use too much of another person's words in what is supposed to be my essay. I have learned from my teachers in high school that we should not have the majority of our piece be quotations. Along with that, it has been drilled into me that I always need to cite and ideas or quotations I use in my writing. I have always had to use the MLA format in school, so sticking to that format is second nature to me at this point. This has helped me stay organized and keep my writing uniform. The downside of this is that I am extremely unfamiliar with the Chicago and APA formats. I am going to have to learn these if I need to use them in my academic days and beyond. One thing that I struggle with is creating a clear divide between paragraphs and ideas in my essays. Recently for my INTD 105, I ran into this issue with a piece. I failed to properly divide it into multiple paragraphs which caused it to be disorganized. I also sometimes struggle with rewriting the same idea multiple times but in different ways when I run out of things to say on a particular topic. I usually did not get points taken off for this in high school but I know when I need to write in college, professors will most likely not let things like this slide. I would definitely like to improve these parts of my writing and others sooner rather than later. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Yannis Dimitroff ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[When I write anything I try to focus on being entertaining. If the reader is entertained they will be able to connect with my work and are less likely to lose my point. It's very similar to a lecture: one professor may be able to get the point across sluggishly to a few students who are still able to muster up some attention. While another professor may be able to be active, show some examples, and connect the concept to real world situations. The latter professor will more often than not, connect to more students than the former. Many professors or students who I ask to review my writings often tell me something along the lines of: "You have a personal and unique way of writing." Recently, in my INTD 105 class, I had to write a paper based on a popular misconception. In my paper I talked about the myth of thicker hair being grown after shaving. One way in which I like to entertain the reader is to give them something to chuckle about. Everyone in my class is familiar with the term \"big-pharma\" or \"big-tobacco.\" I played off that theme by joking around and saying in my paper: \"Some may think it\'s \'big-razor\' trying to get us to buy more razors.\" Entertainment is a vital skill that takes a lot of self-awareness; however, there is always room for improvement and I hope to develop in a lot of other aspects. One example being grammar, as it seems to be a simple fix by just downloading the Grammarly extension; however, it\'s dangerous to be dependent on such applications. I tend to discover grammar mistakes when I re-read my work the next day, but some fly under the initial editing process. For example, I noticed a few run-on sentences in my college application letter which I could have avoided by using semicolons or commas. I hope to work on this aspect sooner rather than later, and one way to work on it is by noticing mistakes and not to repeat them in later works. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} -Yannis Dimitroff ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Danielle Crowley ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Danielle Crowley INTD 106 Self-Reflection I focus the most of grammar and punctuation in my writing. I feel that it is important to have good grammar and flow throughout your writing in order for the reader to properly understand your point and allow for the piece to be read with ease. For example, when I look over my essays before submitting them, I look for misplaced commas, sentences that don't flow well together, and errors in sentence structure. I find that looking in these areas in particular not only improves my writing, but also helps me to go back and find areas in need of improvement in regards to content. This strategy allows me to not only read over my work and make it better, but it also helps me ensure that I am not losing points on silly mistakes or errors. I find that an area I can improve on in my academic writing is the use of quotations. I feel that when I quote a source in a paper, I don't explain it well enough or I rely on it more than I should. For instance, in a history course last semester, I found that the majority of my paper was quotations from the text, with a brief explanation of why the quotation is important. For instance, for a paper last semester, I quoted the following about the conquest of Latin America, "Although scholars today refer to the period from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century as the Age of Discovery, many of the lands that Europeans "discovered" were already inhabited by rich and vibrant indigenous civilizations for tens of thousands of years...". I could have rephrased this quote into my own works rather than quoting the article directly. Instead, I could have written, "Although historians describe the conquest as 'an age of discovery,' the European settlers found land that was, in fact, already discovered and settled by highly advanced civilizations". This paraphrase gets the same point across in my own words while still using information from the source. I want to be able to use more of my own words to explain why a quotation is relevant and important rather than hoping that the quote will do that on its own. I believe that this would improve my writing, make papers more my own, and allow me to think more critically about a topic to make more valuable connections between the material taught in class and the paper.

I reread my drafts in order to make sure that all my ideas are relevant and they all help to prove my main point. I make sure that all the details make sense within the argument and that they support my main idea. When I write essays, I find it easier to write the body paragraphs first where I just try and answer the prompt to the best of my ability without worrying about quotes or a thesis statement. I will often just write down my own personal thoughts or ideas as well as background information I have from prior research. Then I will try and refine these ideas into a stronger argument that can be better supported by facts and evidence and not just my own personal feelings. For example, when I write a paper I will often start with ideas I have such as "I believe the main argument is this, because when I read the article these things that were said stood out to me" and then talk more about what the main idea is and what about it I found so important. Then, I will rewrite the sentences to get rid of the use of personal pronouns and other thoughts stating my feelings, but leaving the description of the main idea and some basic quotes or specific words I remember being used in the article. When I have developed my argument, I find quotes that support it and add them as well as their analysis within what I have written. Lastly, I use the ideas I have developed to make thesis statements and write an introduction and a conclusion. Then I reread my essay and make sure my argument answers the prompt and has lots of supporting evidence.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect I want to develop effectively for writing is the ability to better organize my writing. I think that although my writing contains much-supporting informatio]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[n, it is sometimes unorganized and some of the thoughts seem random or out of place. I believe that if I can find a better way to organize my thoughts it will help to enhance my argument as all my ideas will flow better and help the reader to better understand my argument. I also think this would be a good thing to focus on as it would allow me to write better thesis statements and create better introductions.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jennifer Bodzon ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jennifer Bodzon]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [02/10/2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my own writing, I have found I have an easy time laying out my thoughts and creating a structure in my writing. It's easy for me to establish a guide which my writing will follow by using a thesis statement to set up the rest of my paragraphs. This has helped me in writing persuasive essays, research essays, and even writing speeches. I went through my old writing pieces and found a speech I wrote for my final project senior year. I provided three main points in my introduction, and followed through with explanation for them in the upcoming paragraphs. In my speech I say "I believe in choices, I believe in loss, and most of all I believe in replacing broken chairs." Although without explanation, it may not make sense I proceeded to explain each point. Each belief had subordinating points and personal stories explaining what I meant. I explained how choosing to be good is hard, but always worth it. I explained how badly loss hurts, but provides growth in a way you could never expect. I explained a story of how my dad once broke my favorite chair, replacing it with one that wasn't as comfy. The gesture itself made me realize how sorry he was, and how for the first time I felt genuine forgiveness. Although it was written as a speech I planned on sharing with over a hundred people, I felt that it was easy to follow and keep base with my main idea. It was clear that my speech was about losing my dad, making the choice to forgive him, and bettering myself from the loss. I've realized that laying out my paragraphs like this makes it easier for me to provide evidence and stories to back up my argument or thesis. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing I would love to work on in college is making my writing more concise. I feel like I constantly put in words and unneeded sentences to fulfill a word count or page requirement. I find it difficult to find words and evidence that backs up what I need it to, without it sounding like I am just trying to fill up the word count. One time specifically I noticed this was for my Anthropology final. The paper had to be three pages, and I added words and random thoughts until I barely crossed those three pages and met the minimum requirement. I believe if I plan out my writing more and give myself more time to do things my writing will be more to the point and flow better. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jared Benson ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jared Benson]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of writing that I already focus on is the establishment of a clear and concise argument so that the emergence of the writing is coherent from the start. In doing so, I make sure to alter the use of my words in efforts to enhance the gravity of the point I'm delivering. It's important that the reader is drawn in and able to understand the reason of the argument being made. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I recently wrote an essay highlighting the significance of the student debt issue in America and how the rising cost of college tuition is causing a decline in the amount of people capable of attending. It is an ongoing issue that only continues to grow as the years pass, and I am confident in my own skills that I was able to deliver both a sense of fear and urgency, while staying on topic and keeping the reader hooked with concrete facts. As soon as my claim was clear, I made sure to follow it up directly with statistics in support of the argument. "One primary cause is the ease of acquiring student loans. In 2017, there was an accumulated \$1.48 trillion in total U.S. student loan debt. That's 44.2 million Americans with student loan debt just within our borders. Many students, post-graduation, are more concerned about their loans rather than the next, exciting chapter of their young lives." Later in the essay, once the reader has an increased understanding of the topic, I put some stress on the subject matter to represent the importance of the issue. "It leaves people distraught, unable to pay off what seems to be endless college bills, hindering future life goals." In an example like this, I\'ll first write down the base of the idea I\'m trying to get across and I\'ll brainstorm (better sounding) synonyms of the words that I should use. Instead of "upset", I used "distraught" and instead of "slowing down", I used "hindering."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Although I view myself as an effective writer, I certainly haven\'t perfected all features of writing. One aspect that I am working on developing is the use of sentence length. I am aware that varying sentence length is a skill writers use to keep the content fresh without making it seem repetitive, however I tend to use run on sentences from time to time.

Conclusions are important because they wrap up the main argument that was delivered in the essay. It is a way to remind the reader of the key points that were made. I typically struggle with bringing the whole paper together and finding a smooth way to wrap it up. My high school writing teacher had us do exercises in which she would give us an essay that contained everything except for the conclusion. Our task was to write a strong conclusion based on the paper we read. This exercise helped me focus on bringing up the key concepts once more and helped me learn how to wrap up the paper in a coherent way. An example of this thought process is after I write the entire paper, excluding the conclusion, I read through it and pull of the main ideas and write them in the conclusion as I read along. Then I finish it off with a closing statement that summarizes everything I had just said, basically restating the thesis statement. In a recent essay, written on the philosophy of love, I started my conclusion with, "Overall, Lysias' speech to choose the non lover over the lover does not have many valid points." Then, I briefly revisited each point made throughout the essay. After this I wrote, "In conclusion, choosing the lover over the non lover is the more intelligent choice. Lysias' arguments seem to counteract one another." By using statements such as "overall" and "in conclusion", it grabs the reader\'s attention once more and puts the main point of the essay forward.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I wish to work on including a higher level of vocabulary. I constantly find myself using words such as "good" when there are many others that would make the paper sound much more intelligent.

This was an area I previously had trouble with when I was younger as English was my third language learned after moving to America. This skill is important for writing because having a well put together paper is much more important than just having all the criteria requirements of the paper. Having a well-written paper requires every sentence to be written that way. I have begun using extension apps like Grammarly which recommends improvements to the writing as you type. This has taught me to choose better vocabulary when doing so. As I am still working on this I have come far in my work. \"[There is a similarities between the two. Before I began with the entropy process of my symbolic drawing I had drew a realistic self image of myself.\" The first sentence was recommended phrases by Grammarly to be translated as, \"There is a clear point of intersection between these.

I feel that if I elevate my standard of wording and phrasing, I will sound more intelligent and will come across as someone who really cares about what they're writing, which I do care. Oftentimes, I will reference a thesaurus to look for the best possible word for the sentence I'm trying to write. For example, when I write an email to a professor, I will make sure that my email doesn't contain any errors and spelling mistakes. I will fix those first, and then I will try and find words that can be replaced with more intelligent sounding words. For example, in my final essay for a sociology course last semester I stated this, \"The period after WWII where the economy bloomed and expanded in America is referred to as "The Golden Age of Capitalism"\". My original sentence didn\'t include the word \"bloomed\" but instead said \"started\". I think that the switch of the wording sounded much more enticing to read. This skill is very important, especially when you move into the professional world. You can't send emails to your boss with simple words or errors; they won't take you seriously. If you choose to use more intelligent words, however, they will have more respect for you and want to listen to what you have to say. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As far as a writing skill I want to improve on, I would really like to get better at punctuation and different ways to form a sentence. I know when to use periods, question marks, and exclamation points, but I want to improve on knowing where and when to insert a comma, colon, or semicolon. Knowing how to do this is important because without it, the sentence I have written most likely won't make sense and/or won't convey the message I'm trying to get across.

I use descriptive words and examples so that my writing is credible and believable. I avoid using first person pronouns such as "I" and "you" and so on, to the best of my ability. I realize that in some papers, it is necessary but research and other related papers should be professional and not personal. This aspect is very important to set your paper apart from others that may be received by a prospective employer, college or research opportunity. Making your evidence and argument the readers main priority is key, rather them having to read it from your, possibly bias, opinion. In high school, and even my first semester in college, I have always been taught instead of saying something for example like "I believe..." or "I proved..." in research conclusions, it is more professional to directly state the information and say "It was proven.." and so on. I really try to focus on that and other aspects to make my paper sound as professional and mature as possible. Looking at the latest paper I wrote, it proved difficult to implement this aspect but I figure out a way to reword the phrase to improve it for the reader. For example, I wrote in my paper "From those items, it can be concluded with certainty that her name is..." There were many more examples of this but here I had to figure out a way not to say "I concluded..." and in turn, the phrase I used sounds more professional and official.

I've always had trouble figuring out when a sentence needs a comma for a break, and when they need to just be stopped there. As I dealt with this situation, I've noticed my papers becoming a lot more formal and better to read. When I was writing my last paper, which happened to be recent for Intro to Behavioral Methods, I had to re-read my paper almost a dozen times to find certain mistakes. My first major mistake was when I was writing this sentence "In order to get a good sample, Draghici tested two classrooms". I originally wrote "In order to get a good sample Draghici tested two classrooms". But, as per usual I lacked a comma, it took me quite some time for me to realize that between the work "sample" and "Draghici" I needed a comma. Another example of my inability to use commas correctly is actually in this paper itself. I was trying my hardest not to forget my comma, that I happened to put a comma where it did not belong.

An example of this would be if I began a paragraph I would start my paragraph with my topic "Doing homework earns better grades", then I would incorporate quotes and other data to help prove my point. After stating my example to help support my claim I would once again remind the audience of my topic "77% of all students who completed every homework assignment finished with an A+."

For example, if I use a quote I have trouble being able to connect that quote to my writing and be able to explain my claim in a way that is most meaningful. When I use such examples, I summarize much of what the author of the example says rather than what I am trying to say in my writing. I don't always allow myself to put my own voice in my writing when talking about a specific topic and backing that topic up with examples.

A thesis is the basis to a bigger claim one is trying to make to their reader. It introduces the goal of the paper and how to achieve it. I was made aware of the salience of thesis statements by my English professor in an American Literature class. She presented to me the method of entering into a conversation with your reader in your thesis by responding to what others are saying. Many templates were shown that shaped my skills as a writer for the better and engaged my audience instead of plainly stating my claims. For example, as a class we focused on *The Bluest Eye *by Toni Morrison as a prominent piece of American writing and my thesis simply explained why emotional violence had poor effects on the main character. After using a template, I had a higher sense of trust in my ability to write. This method of engaging my reader made for a more intriguing work. I ended up with, "By digesting the different forms of violence presented in*The Bluest Eye *by Toni Morrison we are shown that emotional and mental violence regarding white standards of beauty is the prominent threat to young Pecola Breedlove, in particular; it is important to look at this aspect of the text because it shows that this type of violence, and not physical violence, is what results in psychological damage." I showed what others were saying in regards to strictly physical violence inflicted upon Pecola Breedlove and countered with why emotional abuse was the prominent threat. I believe improving one's capability to delve into academic writing will be only beneficial as it is used ubiquitously in a lifetime and will further growth of being the best you can be. One aspect of writing I would like to develop more efficiently at Geneseo is a constant flow of thought throughout the work instead of one thought in one paragraph and one thought in another. This makes for choppy writing and does not give the appearance of a stream of consciousness. I find it easier to fall back into the habit of explaining one thing in paragraph, however I have been told that if you could move your paragraphs around freely in a paper then it is not satisfactory as they should all have their place. Connecting paragraphs to make for a more complete and cohesive work is something I strive to improve on. I feel in INTD 106 this goal is undoubtedly attainable. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kathryn Solomon ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I write essays, I am always very conscious of synthesizing and comparing ideas in an order that makes the most sense. While I revise my drafts, I put myself in the reader\'s perspective and take note of anything in my writing that might seem misplaced. I believe that being able to synthesize my writing is very important because without it, no one would be able to clearly understand my argument. Last semester when I was taking Environmental Issues, I went to the Writing Learning Center to get help for revising my case study which I titled, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[How Deforestation Affects Biodiversity in the Southeast Asian Rainforest]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I remember specifically when I went to that appointment being told that my ideas followed accordingly and that she was able to understand the order of my thoughts, but there was one issue. I began my study by highlighting the issue of deforestation in general and then specifying the issues found in Indonesia. Next, I began to talk about a particular source and how it related to my topic, " The Leuser Ecosystem in Indonesia was visited by Leonardo DiCaprio in his film, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Before the Flood]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. He described that deforestation is mainly happening in this area so that palm oil plantations can be grown". After these two sentences I almost went off on a tangent on what food items palm oil is found in. This distracted the reader because my main focus of that paragraph was what the effects of deforestation are, not what palm oil is found in. Therefore, this appointment was able to show me to keep my ideas in a specific order and to try not to get distracted by minuscule details that might belong elsewhere in my study. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [During my time at Geneseo, I would like to become completely comfortable with using an active voice in my writing. Oftentimes I find myself passively talking in my writing when I don't intend to do so. There were some sentences in my case study that my professor reordered because I didn't happen to catch that I was talking passively. It's kind of difficult to explain, but I think I tend to use an excessive amount of words at a time when I don't really need that many. To change that I could probably just think to myself if any of my words are unnecessary or if I could re-word some of my sentences. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Romany Snider =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on making my writing as fluid as possible, so my points are clear and accessible to the reader. If a piece of writing is too wordy or the phrasing isn't clear, then the reader will have a harder time understanding what is being said and may have to read the section over again. I know one of my pet peeves is having to read a section again just so I know what is being described, so I extend that to my writing to be clear. For example, a sentence may be phrased like "Jim, Sarah, and Terry went into class, and while Jim found the class to be a complete bore, Terry thought the class was enthralling, all while Sarah struggled to stay awake; meanwhile, the teacher passed out homework." There are too many pieces of information in this sentence which makes it difficult for the reader to figure out what is important. A clearer rephrasing of this sentence would be "While Jim found the class to be boring and Sarah struggled to stay awake, Terry was enthralled by the material." This sentence cuts out all the irrelevant information about the teacher, leaving the focus on the students and some of their character traits. At Geneseo, I hope to work on writing in a more detailed fashion so my points are not lost. Sometimes, in my writing, the specifics of certain events are described vaguely and it makes it hard for the reader to know exactly what I mean. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nakkia Smalls =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I tend to focus on while revising drafts is syntax because that's the difference between a full-fledged paper and a paper that lacks effort. I think it is very important to construct intricate and meaningful sentences. A paper is much more effective when there are concise and well-developed sentences rather than a plethora of vague mediocre sentences. The way sentences are constructed in a paper is the ability for the reader to learn something about your topic. If the sentence can read word for word my sentence structure is vague. I think the most effective reads I've written and seen has been the ones that make me work through the sentence towards a meaning: not saying I want to confuse the reader rather want them to get the full effect of my sentences and use words in my sentence as way to work towards the meaning in a way that is not confusing. I am confident that I can construct effective sentences by continuing to implement the strategies that my high school English teachers have taught me. They encouraged and combatted my habit of run-on sentences by helping me understand that I can synthesize the sentences using synonyms of vague words. I was able to create smaller sentences, enhance my sentences to have more purposeful meanings and develop my vocabulary with advanced words. For Example, I would have a complex sentence with a bunch of words that did not hold much meaning "Modern day segregation comes in three different connected categories that have a straight effect on minorities capacity to do well in the world compared to their counterparts: residential segregation, socioeconomically segregation, and school segregation." But, using the tactics my teachers have shown me I then can turn that sentence into a more advanced and meaningful sentence that reads better "Modern day segregation appears in three interconnected categories that directly impact minorities ability to succeed compared to their white counterparts: residential, socioeconomic, and school segregation." Going forward I'd like to focus on how to create a good balance between sources as well as when to paraphrase and when to quote a piece of text. I think sometimes I pick sources that further develop each other rather than make a new argument towards developing the claim, which causes me to overemphasize in my own sentence to make up for this disconnect. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katie Singleton ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I focus on is punctuation. My English teacher in high school stressed the importance of "punctuation for power". In his explanation, punctuation is a fundamental part of writing and communication: it gives you the power to relay information accurately and develop your voice as a writer. Writers often create confusing sentences without direction or run-on sentences which make content hard to understand. Additionally, punctuation allows you to develop a unique voice. A reader does not want to listen to monotone sentences of the same general length and pattern throughout an entire paper. As a result, I believe that I have a pretty powerful voice that can be easily understood via correct and helpful punctuation. For example, in a piece written about a powerful figure in my life, punctuation allowed me to describe listening to my dad singing in a unique way. Originally I wrote, "I heard my dad signing all the time. He would sing in the car, making dinner, and even doing the lawn work. However, he sounded much different with a whole band beside him." After revision and considering punctuation, I am able to write, "Although it was not rare to hear my dad singing all the time- in the car, making dinner or even doing the lawn work- these evenings were different because he had a whole band beside him." My memories are tied together in a concise way that changes the rhythm and is easy for the reader to follow. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One area of my writing that I would like to improve is my voice. I was not aware of the concept of passive vs. active voice until late in my high school career; however, it is actually a very important feature of writing. Although I understand the importance of using an active voice in writing, it is hard to write in a different voice on the spot. I think that using an active voice makes my writing sound more mature and professional, so I would like to strive to develop my writing voice to be more active. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sarina Singh ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Everytime I write a paper, whether is be a report on a recently read novel or an essay analyzing a poem, I make sure I use evidence to back up my thesis. Incorporating quotes that seamlessly slide in throughout my paper is an aspect I am constantly aware of as I write. The use of quotes in a paper help shape it to present its thesis in a clear and concise manner. When I read papers I look at a quote to see what purpose it poses to the reader. Is it drawing attention to a certain theme? Is it a proper example of what is being analyzed? When a quote is placed in a paper and does not seem to serve a proper purpose, the reader is left confused and the writer is left with a weak paper. This is why I choose to carefully include what quotes to use when writing a research paper on the novel *Kafka on the Shore*. Initially when writing about the author I choose to exclude a quote he gave in an interview about his book. When editing my paper later on I realized that including the quote would add more understanding to the theme of the novel and would better help the reader understand what I did when reading. As Murakami concludes in his interview, "the connection between these worlds (the real work and dream world) cannot, and should not, be fully explained" (Simmons). Before the quote, I did not include the author, Murakami, take on these two worlds that are so prevalent in the story. I found that his statement added depth to my paper and helped make my claim stronger. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect I want to develop effectively as I continue to better my skills as a writer is having the ability to project an active voice through my text. I find through my writing that I use the same phrases when demonstrating the feelings of a character or writer, and I catch myself rotating through the same words. Determining an insightful manner in which to present your thoughts on a text or to a colleague is a skill that is not just tested in the classroom. It follows you throughout your career and it is for this reason I think that having an active voice in writing is a skill I should focus on improving as I write. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tahrima Siha ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing that I focus on most is the use of reasoning after a statement. I not only like to make it clear to my readers exactly what I'm trying to convey, but also *why* I'm trying to convey it. I have a habit of explaining almost all to every point that I make in an essay. It doesn't necessarily have to be in an argument or persuasive essay, but it also happens in creative essays and such. I believe that the purpose of writing is to express oneself through visualizable words instead of verbal or live interaction. For that reason, I always feel the need to explain everything that I write so that my readers don't have to question themselves about what I'm trying to explain. One such example is: "Violence has decreased in the world today." This is a "bland" statement. My example, after using my reasoning technique, would read: "In comparison to the body counts of homicides, war victims, and genocide from the past two centuries, the rate of violence has decreased by a few factors where we stand in time today. There are still homicides and wars taking place every day, but the death count caused by these acts of violence have decreased drastically. Therefore, violence, in general has decreased." One mistake I tend to make time and time again in writing is adding too much "fluff." I consider myself more of a creative writer than a successful academic writer, in which case "fluff" is not a bad idea. In research papers or argumentative essays, however, it does not serve that great of a purpose. I would like to be able to cut down on filler words and get straight to the point with a smooth transition by the end of this course. I would like to become a strong academic writer and learn of terms and techniques that would help me get my point across without writing too long of an explanation. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grant Shoemaker ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} My writing in my opinion and also the opinions of my previous English teachers is how often my voice is shown. I demonstrate, or so I believe, a strong voice of my own in the sense that when someone is reading my writing, they can tell that it's my paper they've picked up. Although most professors don't necessarily idealize the use of voice in writing above all else, I believe it's one of my few literary skills that I nail in my writing. For instance, in my writing I say statements such as, "If I see a house without a bed my next move is typically to run because whoever lives there is clearly a maniac." The way I describe the absence of a bed in a house is something I'd truly say in everyday conversation. Now I may be blowing it out of proportion, but I believe that the presence of voice in my papers is unlike any other in this level of writing. One aspect in my writing I believe that could use a bit of development is my diction. I find that I tend to use the same language in my papers, which really restricts the potential of what I can produce, literary wise. It causes the reader to lose interest which most commonly lies with the fact that no one wants to read the same thing, over and over again. Therefore, the development of more diction in my writing will not only benefit me, but my professors who are forced to read my work. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Michael Sheedy ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Michael Sheedy Dr. Gillian Paku INTD 106: Conventions of College Writing 10 February 2019 During the writing process, I focus my revisions around cutting down wordy sentences. Cutting down on wordiness is an important skill for me because I tend to overwrite and run into problems with word counts and page limits. As a younger student, I assumed longer sentences were more professional. However, it wasn't until my first semester at Geneseo that I took my teachers' suggestions to cut wordiness seriously. I found that my point was often lost upon the reader through the addition of unnecessary clauses. In order to be an effective writer, you must get your point across to the reader. Since wordiness was prohibiting my ability to do so, it was crucial that I worked on this skill. For example, in the rough draft of a Geography paper, I wrote, "Known as urban primacy, the concentration of a country's urban population in a single city is often seen as a step backwards because it affects countries in several aspects such as development, economy, and politics." While reading the sentence during revision, it seemed excessively wordy. Therefore, I cut the sentence down to, "Urban primacy is typically a step backwards because it affects a country's development, economy, and politics." I used the prior sentence to define urban primacy in order to cut the definition out of the sentence. I also cut out "in several aspects such as" because it was unnecessary. By implementing effective and concise sentences, I feel my writing's effectiveness and clarity have both improved. In the future, I feel I have to improve my separation of evidence and analysis. Whenever I include evidence from outside sources, I have difficulty indicating when the outside evidence ends and when my analysis starts. My professors have often been confused and asked me to make this distinction clearer in my writing. In order to improve this, I should transition into my analysis with argumentative language, such as "Although," "However," or "As a matter of fact." I believe this will help me to transition into my own voice effectively by making it clear when my personal thoughts enter the writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Vanshika Sharma ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} An aspect of academic writing I feel that I do well in is using creative figurative language and vocabulary in order to display the message I\'m trying to share with the reader in an effective and precise manner. I think that metaphors and similes are very useful, as they can help to compare complex situations to familiar ones especially when writing about stories with winding plot lines or conflicted heroes. Situations like \"Siduri asked Gilgamesh to stay, when he wanted to go to Utnapishtim to find the secrets of immortality\" can be explained in terms of \"Siduri was offering Gilgamesh some of the most important human needs, food, shelter, clothing, love \-- but he had to fulfill his goals instead, similar to situations that students who are leaving for college may face when choosing between their love or their goals, not knowing whether to stay and be happy where they are or to go away and discover what they feel they are owed to.\"\ Something that I\'d really like to develop is the organization of my essays. I feel that I can have a lot of difficulty starting off my essays and papers, my introductions always feel repetitive to me. I\'d like to be able to improve that and also be able to present my ideas in a more effective manner. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Quinten Seskin ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I focus on making sure that the introduction of my essays begins broadly, with regards to the topic of the essay, and ends with a complex thesis statement that is specific and narrow nature. I find that complex thesis statements are a critical component to every essay, due to the fact that they inform the reader about what will be argued in the paper. Furthermore, I had learned from my public speaking Professor last semester, Dr. Bullinger, that the introduction is the most important part of any speech or essay, as it lays down a loose structure of what will follow in the remainder of the piece. However, he identified the thesis statement as the most important aspect of any introduction, because without an effective thesis statement, readers will not be able to fully comprehend the direction in which the paper will go. An example of using this technique of would be beginning with a broad topic like "what it means to be American in this day and age" and referring to historical background information in the introduction to inform the reader that the concept of being "American" is deeply rooted in a complex history. By then choosing a specific angle to approach the topic, such as the influence of Irish and Chinese immigration in the 1800s on shaping the definition of "American," I can then begin to form my thesis statement. I begin my thesis statement by using argumentative diction: "Though at the time, this drastic shift in history seemed spontaneous and unpredictable, in retrospect, signs of change can be clearly identified." Though I have already made an argument in this sentence, I want to further expand on it so that I my argument can be as specific as possible: "Consequently, America's first naturalization laws, in addition to Irish immigration resentment, can be viewed as the precursor to the persecution of Chinese immigrants in the mid-nineteenth century." By making my thesis complex, I can then utilize concrete research and historical evidence to argue my standpoint in the following body paragraphs and effectively answer the broad topic that was originally given.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like to ensure that the topic sentences of each of my body paragraphs are strong and connect to the thesis statement. I think that sometimes I focus too much on the content of each paragraph and then the topic sentences become an after-thought as a result. Strong topic sentences would then allow my essays to flow naturally and cohesively from one paragraph to the next, with each paragraph building on to the next.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Mia Serritella ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I try to make a conscious effort to keep my sentences concise and emphasize quality over quantity. Often times students use wordy, complex sentences to fulfill their word count or sound intelligent. However, this mindset tends to steer the writer away from the focus of the paper. While I think it is important to have a variety of sentence lengths, lengthy sentences can become tedious to a reader. I believe a good paper prioritizes a strong argument supported with evidence and logical reasoning rather than the amount of sophisticated words used. My INTD teacher recently spoke to my class about the blemishes in our papers and told us to "write as if every word costs you money." By keeping this suggestion in mind, I find myself using less words and sentences as filler. One of the ways I practice this is by limiting my use of the word "very" before an adjective and instead replace the phrase with a more descriptive word. For example, in my recent INTD paper I wrote about how much someone could learn about another person through the contents of their wallet or social media. Instead of using the phrase "very little" in this paper I changed it to "insufficient" in my final draft. Although such small changes seem to be insignificant, they can vastly improve the quality of a paper. Writing is such a versatile tool with many opportunities to learn and improve. One of the ways I can refine my writing is to be more analytical rather than observational. In the future I can develop this skill by constantly asking myself the "Why" rather than mainly referring to the "Who, what, when, and where" when writing. By doing this, I could enhance the way I examine and develop my thesis, thus strengthening my argument. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Samier Serrano ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on making my background information in my introduction as thorough as possible because this is where I reinforce the key points in my essay, also it allows me to provide historical context in case the reader doesn\'t have any prior knowledge. During my Highschool years, I struggled with this skill the most and in result of this my papers came up short. Until my advisor, who I was very close with gave me a tip to create a web chart to see everything that related to the main topic of my essay. My background information went from this " The water crisis affects every continent. Although there is water all over the world that does not mean that it is clean." to this "Countries with the most poverty are most likely to deal with water stress because they lack good sanitation. Water stress is when there is a low amount of water that people in the area can have access to. In the continent of Africa, there are fourteen countries that cannot get access to safe drinkable water. In Honduras, 1.4 million of 8 million people can not drink clean water because it isn't accessible to them." Furthermore, as I write my essays I remember this skill even to this day because so far in college no matter what subject it is I somehow always find a way to write a few research papers. I usually also struggle closing out my paper because I realized that I start of my papers strong but in my in conclusion I lose momentum. I think maybe in solution to this I could just relate more to modern times to finish off my essays. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jillian Serrano ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I focus on making my introductions clear and straight to the point. I believe that it is important for the reader to understand exactly what your argument is, and what point you are trying to make. When I write a thesis statement I make sure that my argument is very clear. One of my high school English teachers had explained that your thesis does not have to be complicated. Sometimes if you try to over-explain your thesis, your argument can become unclear or just sound confusing. In my introductions, I also try to add specific facts or statistics that will support my argument. My teacher from high school had taught us that it can be beneficial to start off the introduction with a specific fact, thus pulling the reader in from the start. She had given us a template which consisted of starting off with a specific fact/statistic, explaining your point of you, then ending it off with your thesis statement. For example, for one of the argumentative essays I had written last year in high school, the question being asked was, "Is joining a sorority or fraternity in college worth it?" I started off my introduction with, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Hazing is a plague in our society. 55 percent of college students involved in clubs, teams, and organizations experience hazing]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ Alcohol consumption, humiliation, isolation, sleep deprivation, and sexual acts are hazing practices common across all types of student groups." I then explained how I felt about this and ended my introduction with my thesis. "The effects hazing has on students can be devastating to their mental and physical health. Because of hazing, joining a Greek life organization in college is not worth it."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One skill that I would like to improve on is writing conclusions. I think that I sometimes just restate my introduction when writing my conclusions. I feel that a strong conclusion is needed to further solidify your argument. I think that I also tend to say too much in my conclusions. Perhaps I could end my conclusion with one last piece of evidence, while also restating my thesis.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Briana Senear =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Briana Senear ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [First Self-Reflection]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/10/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ INTD 106 ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One important aspect of my writing that I choose to work consciously on is my wording. I try extremely hard not to repeat many words and to incorporate different vocabulary into my writing. I may use outside sources to try and find synonyms for basic words to improve how my writing sounds. My senior year high school English teacher seemed to help me with this substantially. I would always complete essays early because my teacher would revise it with me so I could understand exactly where I needed to change wording and improve my writing. Instead of using basic words in a sentence such as "Geneseo is my favorite college," I would elaborate and say something more along the lines of, "SUNY Geneseo is a stunning school where the best of the bets academic based students go to further their education." I believe that wording is one of, if not the most, important aspects to an essay or piece of writing because if you use bland language in your writing the reader will become disinterested. My high school English teacher pushed me to use resources that were available to me to improve my writing and now I really enjoy using my mindful creativity to write essays and writing that speak to people. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One part of my writing I could definitely improve would be not running on sentences. I need to get more to the point sometimes because a reader will become bored with my pieces of work.

I think one way to help improve this would be to possibly be more organized. If I know exactly what I am trying to say before I just try to write a paragraph about it I will be able to construct better sentences to help get my idea or point across. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(343 words)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Schwarz =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I mostly spend my time thinking about how to plan out my papers in a precise format so that when I have to start writing it. In this process, I try to focus on quote embedding and how they will fit into the papers with all the information. One of the major writing projects I had to do for completing high school was to write a SIPs project. This was a Senior Inquiry Project where you created a question you wanted to research and answer through a paper and presentation. This project taught me how to properly embed quotes and how to later explain them. I did my project on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and other cardiovascular system disease, how advancements in medicine can either prevent the progression or help seek medical assistance. For example, I was introducing the reader to heart disease in the family paragraph about what the disease is and how it can lead to other diseases due to family history, and one example of quote embedding is, "The risk factors of 'CAD, which are similar to those of heart disease, include diabetes, family history of hypertension, obesity, and elevated amount of LDL cholesterol' (Braus)." The ending name in quotations was used to site the name in the bibliography that was placed at the end of the paper. As stated earlier, when I organize, I reread all the quotes that I want to use for an assignment and learned how to properly organize them into categories based on the material and subject; which will then turn into body paragraphs. My main goal is to make the quotes seamlessly work into the sentences will making the information well organized. One aspect of my writing that I want to develop is to work on sentence style and flowing paragraphs. By sentence style, I mean how to make them not choppy and more artistically flowing with strong vocabulary. For example, I write mostly in the scientific, factual sense and I want to develop the ability to write in a more poetic sense with symbolism. I want to develop flowing paragraphs so that I can transition to ideas better. In other words, when I don't know what to write next, I often repeat the previous sentence in a different way and then go to the next idea without a real transition linking them. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Natalie Schuster ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I start an essay, I have my points briefly brought up in the introduction paragraph.

My template includes the rhetorically accurate verb with the transition "in order to" in the first sentence, followed by supporting details and a follow up sentence to flow into the next paragraph. I learned this method of writing a thesis in my high school AP Language and Composition class and I have been relying on it as my go to thesis developer. It has strengthened my writing beyond any layout I have learned before, and even has use for book reports and simple paragraphs that I may be assigned as well. An example of this skill is from a paper I completed on a reading called "Theoretical Perspectives in Sociology" by Chris Hunter and Kent McClelland. My thesis for the response is "the authors assert the constant evolutions and adjustments in society, in order to maintain homeostasis." The rhetorically accurate verb is "assert" where I declared and proclaimed the intentions the authors set for the piece of writing and the clause"in order to" allows for development in the introductory paragraph with supporting details and further evidence.

I have a tendency to repeat the same words consistently throughout my writing, resulting in it not being very interesting. My previous essays have lacked creative language and were very wordy. Throughout the years, peer evaluations of my writings by teachers and fellow students has helped me to recognize this problem. This is a big issue in a piece of writing because it may cause the point I am trying to make to not come across clear. Also, it will cause the reader to become uninterested in the writing. An example of deleting unnecessary words and inserting more creative language into my writing is moving from this sentence: "She took me to try out various instruments, and one summer day we walked into a unfamiliar lady's house to try out another instrument; I left that house that same day knowing that I was going to be a French Horn player" to this revised sentence: "She took me to try out various instruments and one summer day before the start of fourth grade, we walked into a unfamiliar lady's house to try out another instrument; coming home that day, I was overwhelmed with excitement because I knew that I had found my instrument."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward, I would like to concentrate on developing stronger theses/arguments for my essays. I struggle to come up with strong theses that introduce my argument in an interesting but abbreviated manner.

When writing an abstract, I consciously focus on hitting the main points laid out throughout the essay without telling all of the information. If I go on and tell all the information in the abstract, there is essentially no point in reading onward because there is an overload of information. My professor last year had mentioned to me to keep it simple and straightforward, leaving out the details for the body paragraphs. This is important when writing an abstract because you want it to be a short essay of the actual story. I now focus on my main ideas throughout the essay and briefly touch over what I will be talking about. For instance, I wrote in my abstract, "The compromising tactic style only shows a moderate concern for self and others. Compromising may be an easy way out of conflict, but in essence, when we compromise, we give up what we want." In order to make it more precise, I followed my professors' instruction and kept in on the vague side, "In this essay, I use the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Questionnaire (TKCMQ), a 30-question survey that helps identify what conflict tactics I use." I feel as I progressed as a writer my skills in writing a full and concrete abstract has become somewhat of second nature.

By exercising the use of expansive terminology, each sentence becomes more memorable to the reader and as a result the writer's message becomes properly ingrained into the mind of the audience. Without wide use of diction, a writer's paper would lose the interest of the audience and fail to have any significant impact. Through rigorous attention to unfamiliar words used across books I have read in high school and applying myself in vocabulary workshop, I am at ease when I need to quickly come up with synonyms. For example I could have chose to just consistently use vocabulary to describe the knowledge of different words but rather than saying vocabulary this, vocabulary that, I interchange with synonyms such as terminology and diction. I feel being able to develop writing skills is important as it allows me to convey a thoroughly thought out message which invokes the reader to carefully reflect upon the points I will like to explain in the future.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Another writing skill I would like to develop is my ability to keep my sentences short and precise.

These presents a problem for my writing in the sense that I fail to give the reader a brief moment to fully understand the point I am making. Without a clear point to the reader, the entire reason I am writing the essay becomes lost upon the him.

I think that in any kind of writing it is very important to showcase my voice, but with validation from facts based off of what I'm writing about. Any statement is stronger with validation from another source. For example, when analyzing a book, I can infer that a character is scared and stressed, but if I were to restate that sentence through using quotes from the book it becomes more valid: "Under the rule of Hitler and]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ Mein Kampf]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, the Hubermanns are literally 'suffocating' of angst and fear that as any moment they could be caught for hiding Max.

My high school English teacher helped me learn how to fully get my point across with no holes in my argument through encouraging me to look for quotes and resources to make my point stronger. If I were to write "the Hubermanns are scared," my teacher would ask "why?" which helped me realize that automatically including proof to back myself up will allow for the reader to easily understand my argument. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [For my future writing career at Geneseo, I want to focus on thinking about different perspectives. Currently, I can easily use a quote or idea from another source along with my words to further enhance my understanding of a source or book. I think I need to be better at challenging ideas I come across. I can practice this by continuing to incorporate quotes and facts from a source to support a counterargument that I will make off of what the source states. It is important that I realize I don't have to agree with the author that I'm quoting, as long as I can get my argument across. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Cameron Sands =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Cameron Sands]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ One aspect of academic writing that I focus a lot of attention on finding sources for my research papers that are clearly focused on the topic I am writing about, not one sentence on the topic. The source has to be clearly focused on my topic. I also only use sources from credible websites and databases. A way I work on finding thorough sources is using databases where i can search my topic with key words, reading the summary of what the source is about and then making a final decision on whether I should use the source by checking the date of publication, country of publication, etc. This skill is important because it helps you save time by reading a whole article and then realizing it does not relate to your topic in any way, thus wasting time. The high school I went to had the IB program and each person in the IB diploma had to write a long paper called the Extended Essay. My mentor for my essay told me about this trick in writing papers and have been helpful ever since. For example, I had written a paper on Music and Jazz Saxophone in high school and had found a source from a website which did not look like a proper news website but I decided to use the source anyway. The article which took me fifteen minutes to read did not include anything on my topic but a title which was similar to my topic.

Many of my essays come back with comments about needing more detail and literary devices, as sometimes my essays can be mostly factual based.

I use most of my time and concentration expressing my feelings mainly in my body paragraphs because they enable me to develop the argument outlined in the introduction by using supporting evidence and examples. More importantly, through the obstacles and experiences I have encountered throughout my life, I able to write my perspective of the topic/argument in my own craft and emotion. This ultimate freedom of expression throughout my body paragraphs inspires me to spark the reader with a new outlook on a subject matter. However, it is definitely not an easy task to transpire an individual to change their lens. Through the professional guidance of my high school teachers, they have taught me valuable approaches and techniques in order to spark the inspiration to life. For example, it is one thing to just throw a quote to support my evidence, but to utilize the quote as a reference to emphasize my point enhances the reader to appreciate my knowledge of the subject and as a result try to connect to my perspective. For instance, \"35% of all teenagers across the world use social media,\" wouldn\'t touch the reader mentally to change his emotions about social media. On the other hand, \"35% of all teenagers across the world who use social media may significantly harm the development and self - esteem of the individual.\" Therefore, the reader becomes curious of how such a small device could have a profound impact in the growth of his/her life which is where I would develop my ideas towards the topic. As a student of life, I am always trying to improve my abilities and learn new ways to enhance my skills. In the future, I would like my writing to have more structure from beginning to end. In the past, I would go with the flow and see where my ideas takes me. Going forward, I believe will help keep my ideas in line with the given task. One way to apply this technique is outlining my writing before going on to my final draft. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jared Sackett =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jared Sackett]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [A focus of mine in academic writing is finding and discovering the purpose of the paper I am writing. I was told that the purpose of a paper is the most important part because the writer\'s purpose is what will change the reader\'s mind. Attacking a paper with a topic that you are comfortable with or have strong feelings towards allows you to focus and lay out your emotions and values in your writing for anyone reading to feel. I recently had to write a short paper that described an old picture of mine that mattered to me and with a picture of something as important to me as my sister, I had to write with a lot of purpose. As I wrote, I began by explaining the picture and the little details about it until I noticed that the paper sounded too plain and clearly had no purpose. I decided to make the purpose of the paper to make the reader feel sympathy in their heart or even a little joy. I replaced words like "sad" and "loss" with "despair" and "sorrow" to make the reader feel the topic with stronger emotion. One aspect of academic writing I need to work on and would like to improve with my time here at Geneseo is organization. Often times I find myself writing so strongly and passionately about a topic that I lose focus and decide to write freely instead of in an organized fashion. I can correct this in the future by stopping my writing every so often and proof reading my papers periodically instead of waiting for an unorganized mess to untangle itself. By organizing my papers better, I can effectively deliver a powerful theme and support it without run-on sentences and other mishaps that a reader might lose focus on or lose interest in the paper while reading.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Taylor Fritz ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ One aspect of my writing I constantly focus on is my transition sentences in between paragraphs.

There is no point in having good ideas if you cannot express them in an organized and composed way. If I don't, I won't get the point across. This is especially true in argumentative essays and even in debates. I have found that one does not prove anything to anyone no matter how great the evidence is if it is not organized.

One of my favorite teachers in high school was my eleventh-grade English teacher, Ms. Shaw, bonded with me over our mutual beliefs and homogeneous outspoken attitudes. She helped me identify my love for punctuation -- and rather than encourage me to hide it, she taught me to embrace it. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Nevertheless, I tend to rely on punctuation to perfect my writing. One aspect of academic writing I wish to improve is my diction. Typically, I gravitate towards simpler words, so in order to refine my writing, I google the word that comes to mind and substitute it for more complex synonyms. For example, in the first draft of my Common App essay, I stated, "Over the course of just eight weeks, my relationship with my campers caused me to have so much love and devotion for them". Via reviewing my essay with my English teacher, I learned that this statement and various other segments of my piece lacked strong diction. Following this meeting, I altered the sentence to, "By the conclusion of the eight weeks, the bond I had developed with my campers strengthened my love for them". I recognize that my word choice can affect how the reader perceives my intelligence and how well my message is conveyed. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In addition, I would like to focus on making my writing more concise. On occasion, I find it challenging to direct my sentences straight to the point by using too many words and repeating prior concepts. Due to this, I have difficulties satisfying word or page requirements for many assignments. I understand that going forward in my college career, the expectation to respect professors' wishes heightens and I cannot risk receiving a lesser grade as a result of a basic writing skill. I am looking forward to obtaining techniques to improve my diction along with my tendency to ramble. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brooke French =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my writing that I believe I am strong in is my transitions from paragraph to paragraph, or idea to idea. I think that smooth transitions can truly make a piece much easier for the reader to flow from each thought that is being presented. In high school my english teacher focused a lot on letting us have our own style to our writing while still getting the point of the paper across. Through that she helped me develop a strong voice for myself that through my transitions. An example would be when I go from talking about one author to another; "The acceptance Baldwin finds, is something that Maya Angelou watches her Momma portray throughout her childhood". This is much more effective than just going from talking about Baldwin learning acceptance to saying, "Maya Angelou learned from her Momma". Another example could be in a paper where different people I look up to are being talked about. I could go from talking about Thomas Rhett, one of my favorite singers, to talking about my mom because I look up to both of them. If I just ended my paragraph about Thomas Rhett and start the one about my mom with, "My mom also is someone I look up to", that is is so boring. A better transition would be, "Thomas Rhett may be a famous, award winning country star who I love, but he will never pass my Mom on the list of people who I look up to". Transitioning from one idea to the next helps the reader to stay connected to the piece and remember what you have talked about throughout. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward I would like to work on how I analyze quotes in my work. I think that I do a good job of analyzing quotes, but a lot of times I feel as though I am just scraping the surface of what could actually be analyzed, or that I am diving way too far in depth. I hope to be able to find that happy medium where the quote is fully analyzed, but also leaves some of the analyzing up to the reader. I think this will help improve all of my writing because it will allow me to be able to explain my thoughts without making it seem like they are the only thoughts on a given topic. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sydney Freeman ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Every writer wants their work to flow consistently so it appeals to the reader. That is currently my main focus. I like to include strong diction to make the piece have more depth but I often find myself having a hard time with flow. It is important to choice your words wisely because that is what keeps the reader interested. This is a small quote I grabbed from my last essay: "All things that many people may think about but do not necessarily sit down and talk about. My journal has become a physical extension of my brain, reaching the angles of thought that I have never expressed with other individuals." I haven't peer reviewed with many people, but those I have all said it flowed. When I read it, I notice that I use a lot of "and", "but", with a lack of consistency. I currently focus on flow and depth within my writing, but throughout the this course I would like to wind down on proper punctuation so I can avoid overuse of commas and other conjunctions. Once I achieve that, I will be able to focus on my overall rhetoric and have a piece that flows with ease. This will allow my topic to be emphasized and for my detail to stand out. I always feel this sense of anxiety when handing a paper over with the fear of it being lousy, so I would like to focus on confidence in my writing and that starts with proper mechanics. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julia Fred ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Throughout high school, I was taught many skills to help improve my writing. One skill that stuck with me and that I think I perform well would be maintaining structure within my writing. Being taught how to organize my thoughts is a crucial skill because it keeps me from adding in unnecessary details or rambling about material unrelated to my topic. My high school English teacher taught me how to create structured drafts that can easily be transformed into a final paper. One way to express this skill would be through the use of transition words. Transition words such as "also," "in addition," and, "likewise," this advances ones writing because it adds information, reinforce ideas, and express agreement with preceding material. While words like "especially" are used to introduce examples as support, to indicate importance or as an illustration so that an idea is cued to the reader. Saying "My professor is very helpful. She stayed after class to help me with my work," versus "My professor is very helpful. She stayed after class to help me with my work for instance," in this example, placing 'for instance' at the end of the sentence provides the reader with information as to how the two sentences are related.\ Going forward, in college one skill that I would like to improve would be adding more of my own words in my work, to make it more interesting. Having dry, straight to the point writing can become boring and tedious to the reader. I would like to learn how to obtain a more compelling argument within my writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kera Franceschini =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a writer, one of my strong suits is my strong use of vocabulary. While adding a strong use of vocabulary the writer is able to enhance their writing in a variety of ways. A sentence is able to transform itself and nearly create a new meaning. When using a standard variety of vocabulary, reading a paper can get extremely dry while with stronger language it makes it necessary to pay more attention to what you are reading. A good example of this is, "First impressions are bad for society as a whole, it has created bad impressions of people that have left them disadvantaged", this sentence was originally very basic and boring while when transformed to: "First impressions have been the most drastic downfall to society; we have created false pretenses of people that have left them marginalized and disadvantaged", it makes it more interesting to read. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Something that I would like to work on with my writing is my level of analysis following the quotes that I choose. I tend to not expand on my analysis as much as I could to add my opinion to what I'm talking about.

I have always been very diligent when it comes to my grammar and making sure everything is being used properly and in t s most effective way. This skill is important because it is the basic structure of writing and helping to get your point across. Back in high school, one of the techniques that I improved on the most was my grammar. My writing used to be very 2 dimensioned and lacking. In one of my reports for Forensic Science in school, my research project was on Jeffrey Dahmer and my Opening statement was originally, "Being lonely is not only one of the worst feelings in my opinion but by many. Some people deal with it differently and can take it to the extreme." After going back and revising my project, my final opening statement read as "Loneliness. The feeling of being lonely some might say is one of the worst feelings. People deal with loneliness in many ways, and some of those people take it to the extreme by committing crimes." The technique I have been using is write out my thoughts of what I want to say and then when revising, I add depth and description to better get my point across. The only development I can think of is to try to think of the more creative and coherent way of saying what I want to say the first time. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ One of my biggest issues that I would like to focus on developing effectively is my sentence structure such as periods, commas and semicolons. My biggest struggle writing is knowing when to end sentences, and when I need to add semicolons and commas. I tend to make run-on sentences and misuse commas, which always makes it harder for me to have a coherent paragraph.

This was something my English teachers, and teachers who assigned writing assignments regularly as well, made sure to emphasize. For example, instead of starting multiple sentences with "I" or "Also" consecutively, I try to vary my vocabulary or sentence structure so that I can essentially say the same thing without all the repetition. In addition, I try to avoid starting sentences with "And" or "But", because those are conjunctions, and are not meant to be the start of a sentence. Not only was this something my teachers in school pointed out, but it was also something I noticed myself doing as well even in informal writing, and in the writings of my peers, which I found made my own writing and the writings of others sound choppy and overall rather sloppy.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I continue to develop my writing, I would like to focus on finding ways to more effectively weave external evidence into my writing, while still being able to build off of it. I often find myself building off of my own ideas instead of effectively using the ideas found in academic writings of a similar topic and building off of those, failing to insert quotes as often as I should. My writing loses credibility because I fail to cite evidence as a result, and that is something I would like to work on going forward.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tiffany Flores Moran ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing I give attention to the tenses in which I am using whether it be past, present, or future. Maintaining the same tenses throughout the writing lets the reader know how the storyline takes place and helps to clearly established what the writer is communicating. When the proper tenses are not being used it can confuse the reader of the time in the writing is referring to. In middle school, I had a difficult time distinguishing the importance of tenses and how to uphold the same tense until the end of my writing. For instance, if I had a homework assignment that was to write about what I did last week I would have written "Last week I visit my cousins and eat ice cream" instead of "Last week I visited my cousins and we ate ice cream together". When my English teacher noticed how I was struggling we worked together to make sure that when writing I would keep the tense I was using cohesive throughout. Now when writing I can quickly realize when I am no longer writing in the tenses I should be writing in. One aspect I would like to develop effectively in my academic writing is to not only summarize ideas and concepts but also include analysis answering why every detail I mention in my writing is important. In INTD 105, I have come to realize that I spend the majority of my papers citing what others have stated instead of explaining what the importance of my topic is. My INTD 105 professor addressed that readers should not have to wonder why any of the information they are receiving is important because as a writer one should establish that as soon as possible rather than waiting until the end of the paper. Following up with details with of what the significance of what reader is are reading is important or else they are just given statements with no reasoning. This aspect is one of the main goals of the book "They Say, I Say" which provides templates to use to ensure the writer\'s point is getting across. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hayley Fleischer ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Hayley Fleischer\ 2.5.19\ Assignment \#1: Self Reflection\ There are so many aspects when it comes to writing I believe it can be difficult to focus on every single one. I think my strength in writing in persuasion. I like to think of myself as a very strong persuasive writer. I honestly enjoy arguing especially if it something I am passionate about. I work hard to make valid points and statements to allow people to really stop and think about my perspective. I recently have gotten better at seeing the other side of an argument as well. I believe this allows me to make my points stronger because I can counteract the opposing side. When trying to convince people to take my side I try to bring in personal examples. Last semester I wrote a paper on the Affordable Care Act. This healthcare act put in place by President Obama negatively affected my family so in my essay I brought in examples specifically how Obamacare caused an increase in taxes and insurance rates which negatively affected the middle class. "Before Obama, this couple paid about \$450 a month for health insurance with a \$5,000 deductible\... They chose a new, more affordable high deductible plan which they now pay \$1,100 a month with a \$12,000 annual deductible. This plan has worse coverage than their previous one, although they pay more. The wife just recently had a knee surgery that cost \$4,500 and they paid it all out of pocket with no help. This couple is my parents." I felt that if someone could put themselves in my shoes they could really see my side. It is important to be persuasive in your writing so people will actually listen to you.\ One thing I am really weak at in writing is my organization. I feel as though my writing tends to sound choppy and it does not really flow. I really want to improve this so my writing sounds more sophisticated. I think it important to have writing that really flows. It makes it much easier and more enjoyable to read. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emma Flaherty =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus my writing on strong incorporation of author's quotes because that is the foundation and as well as the bulk of the evidence for supporting the thesis. If you simply insert a quote amidst your argument without any type of introduction or explanation, the quote becomes irrelevant and the readability of your essay is tarnished. I feel confident in the way I have been able to achieve this because it was highly stressed in my high school English classes. I was provided with a helpful model to follow accompanied by many examples and chances to practice in the form of other essays and papers. The method I was taught was called the ICE method, where ICE stood for Introduce the quote, Cite the quote, then Explain the quote. This technique encourages thorough and effective incorporations of quotes while maintaining simplicity. An example of the use of a quote before this method would be "Zora Neale Hurston wrote "How It Feels to Be Colored Me" in order to portray her African American experience.'"I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background' (116). James Baldwin also..." The lack of introduction and explanation of the relevance of this quote in regards to a thesis makes this quote obsolete. What I strive for in my essays when utilizing quotes looks something like this, "In her essay "How It Feels to Be Colored Me", Zora Neale Hurston clearly expresses her struggles with discrimination as she was growing up in her community. She writes, "I feel most colored when I am thrown against a sharp white background" (116). Her use of powerful diction with the words "thrown" and "sharp" illustrate the hostile environment she endured everyday as she battled racism and segregation." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [From this point on, I would like to now shift my focus to making my introductory paragraphs portray more of the relevance and significance of my thesis rather than just having filler sentences that lead up to my thesis. I feel like my introduction paragraphs are never as meaningful or insightful as my body paragraphs or conclusions. Perhaps in order to achieve a more sophisticated opening, I could use some sort of context to introduce the issue to show how it relates back to society or life. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(379 words) ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Patricia Figueroa =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Patricia Figueroa ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [02/10/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self Reflection \#1 ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I focus on creating a well developed introduction. When it comes to my writing I tend to find it easier to have an introduction that my audience can follow along with myself. Without a well, clear introduction I find myself lost. Though creating an outline is the most efficient way to start writing a paper or essay, I have always found myself more confused and frustrated when using it. In highschool, my teachers would always give me outline worksheets but they never became a necessary tool when writing my papers. I put a lot of work into my introduction and I actually find that it takes much longer to write my paper when I try to make an outline. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of my mistakes when writing a paper is when I use too many first person pronouns. When I relate to a topic, I tend to forget that I have to write about facts and not opinions. In the future, using fewer first person pronouns in a paper should be easier. Back during senior year of highschool, I had to write the common application essay and I grew extremely frustrated when it felt like half of the words on the page were "I" or "me". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jackson Ferguson ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Jackson Ferguson Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities Due: 2.10.19 One thing that I have added to my academic writing repertoire in the past few years is an insightful, provocative conclusion that steps beyond the immediate scope of my essay. The importance of such a conclusion is that it gives the reader an opportunity to see the argument of the paper in a broader context, strengthening the essay in its ability to advocate a compelling and believable claim. This concept of placing my claim in a larger discussion was likely introduced to me in high school, although I can't put my finger on any one person or moment that taught me to do it. In a paper I recently wrote for an Anthropology class on agriculture and irrigation in Angkor Wat I tried to do just this. Rather than just restating the argument that together, "rice cultivation and state-imposed piety... were two dominant factors in the ascendance of Khmer civilization," I took this claim a step further: "Khmer civilization can be treated as a model that can (at least generally) be applied to other Southeast Asian societies." While in retrospect I could have expanded more on this contextualization of my essay, I was still able to place my argument in a broader discussion. Though it seems like such an obvious pillar of academic writing, I find myself often left with half-baked, unoriginal, and unexciting arguments in my papers. Sometimes (especially when I start a paper late) the majority of my paper is spent summarizing what other people believe, and my own claim is not all that different from theirs. So, my goal for my writing, "at Geneseo and beyond," is to be able to write papers that bring in concrete evidence from all over the place but are still governed by a strong, interesting, unique claim. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Matthew Felix =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write my papers, I focus largely on explaining things in my own ideas, rather than just listing out a plot summary. Papers aren't about just plot summary, as that is easy to do. Papers wants to see your own ideas about a given topic, and it is an important skill that one must learn over the course of their academic career. When I write a paper, I make sure that I use evidence from the given source, and then explain out how that evidence connects to the topic. In a given set of body paragraphs, I may use around three or four direct quotes, depending on the length required to prove my point. With just three or four quotes, I can write several paragraphs linking the quotes to the overall topic of the paper. I greatly improved this skill last semester in my art history class. In it, we had several essays that required direct evidence. In my first essay, my professor told me I need to "explain rather than repeat" as I mostly used plot summary in that essay. During the next essays, I got help from my professor and greatly improved. On the next essay, she said I "greatly improved in explaining my thoughts." At the end of the semester, I found it easy to explain my own thoughts, as compared to the beginning of the semester where I found it challenging. By being able to explain your own thoughts, you show a deeper understanding of the material. If I wrote a paper and didn't include words such as "I" then the professor wouldn't be able to gauge if this was simply a statement I made or a thought of my own I had. In that class, many of the papers had an opinion component, and would ask about how we felt about film or book we read about an artwork. By explaining my own thoughts in the essay, I can successfully convey to the professor that I understood the topic well, and could formulate my own thoughts on it. One area I need to develop is my introduction paragraphs. I have never had strong introductions, and it can be a hinderance to my writing. The introduction is what gets the readers attention, and if you don't have a good one, they may not care enough to continue reading. I often just state basic facts about what I am going to write about, to the point where it sounds boring even to me. A way I can improve this aspect of my writing is by getting help from the writing help center. At my old school, the essays were good enough for my history class to not need help. However, now that I am in an actual writing class, getting solid help from people who know how to help others improve is something I want to do. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Joshua Feldberg ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Josh Feldberg]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/04/18]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of my priorities when I write is to actively change my vocabulary from basics words to more descriptive and precise words. It takes little effort to go through an essay or assignment and utilize basic words that are overused, but when you add powerful words to a writing it creates a world of difference for the reader and it helps emphasize claims I, as the writer, try to make. An example of this comes in an essay I wrote last semester. I could've written something simple like "In order to prove that America is best democracy in the world, something needs to change". I revised it to "In order to reaffirm the notion that America is world's greatest democracy, something will need to be adjusted". It's hard to take the extra time to revise your initial vocabulary when it's so effortless to not, but taking that extra step to do so I believe vastly improves my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An aspect of my writing that I could improve on is the formatting of my works. When I write I typically write in large blocks of sentences and large paragraphs. The issue with writing like this is that the reading doesn't flow, it makes it hard to follow along, or easily lose your place. It also makes it hard for the writer as it can lead to run on sentences making the writing worse. In order to improve this I need to work more on planning ahead of time and having a solid structural plan for what I am writing about in order to break it up. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christina Federico ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I have a strong focus on drawing in readers with a good opening line that encourages them to keep reading. This could be in the form of a question or just something unusual that puts a thought in their head. In high school, my teachers would always tell us that if you can't hook your reader with something interesting then they are going to get bored and lose interest. I am also always attempting to blend my paragraphs together smoothly so that one thought can easily lead to another. I do this by ending one paragraph with a sentence that hints at what the next paragraph could be about. I remember that each time I would do this in past essays, my teacher would make a comment on how much she enjoyed being able to read through my work so smoothly rather than having it be choppy. In my last essay I had written in high school regarding the topic of terrorism, I had ended my first body paragraph with something like "Although the U.S. had experienced turmoil in the past dealing with outside attackers, what was still to come would put the entire population of the country at a standstill." I feel as if these two aspects of my essays always help to make my writing sound more professional. I feel that I need the most development in learning how to bring in more examples of outside evidence instead of constantly using quotes. When I use quotes, I feel as if I am barely doing any work and just filling up more paragraph space that I should be using with other evidence to back up my argument. Going forward, I am going to focus more on digging deeper behind the facts and making connections between certain points to support my topic. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Isabella Fazio ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I already work on my professionalism, and my fluency when writing my papers. My process usually consists of fleshing out a direct and intelligent intro that tells readers what they will be expecting to read during the essay. I break my thesis statement into a rule of three---addressing the three points my argument will hang on in one to two sentences. (Ex: "Like Hamlet, she sacrifices her entire person to her father's command, does not follow her stereotypical role in the play, and is driven to insanity".) I then (usually) begin my first paragraph on the first statement made in this thesis statement. The entirety of this paragraph will only talk about this point. I follow this format for my other paragraphs corresponding to points two and three. As I move from paragraph to paragraph, I transition fairly well with sentences summarizing what I have spoken about in the prior paragraph for clarity. My concluding paragraph includes my introduction's information, but I add other points not addressed before. I then spell check the essay. When I am finished with the basic outline for my essay, if time allows, I will put it away for a night before reading it again. On my reread, I will pick up on better ways to phrase my points, as well as clarity issues. As for how I wish to improve my writing process, I hope to beef up my vocabulary to sound more sophisticated. I believe my voice can sometimes come across as too conversational, and in some essays a more formal voice is necessary. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Arianna Falletta ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect that I tend to focus on consciously when I revise my drafts is that I fully evaluated evidence I used from an outside source to support my argument or thoughts. It is easy to just put quotes or someone else's thoughts into an essay, however, doing this will not lead to a very good essay. Since it is my essay, it should contain my ideas, thought, and arguments. It is important to add sources to support my essay's thesis, however, it is even more important I explain how and why those sources connect to and support my essay. My high school English teachers would give me feedback to always highlight the outside sources I used in my essays when I'm reading it over, and then look after those sources for sentences to further evaluate and explain those sources and how they connect to my thesis. One example of me further evaluating a source I put in one of my previous essays is "According to Kennan's "The Sources of Soviet Conduct", the Soviet Union will begin to attack capitalism abroad since it's the nature of the mental world of the Soviet leaders." In my draft I highlighted that sentence I got from the source and realized I didn't expand on Kennan's thoughts or explain how it connected to my essay. So, I revised it to "According to Kennan's "The Sources of Soviet Conduct", the Soviet Union will begin to attack capitalism abroad since it's the nature of the mental world of the Soviet leaders. Because of this the US feared communism, since they believed communism threatened democracy and the freedoms the people had under a democracy. These statements Kennan made reflected what a large population of people in the US felt, which created a fear and a distrust of the Soviet Union." Going forward, I would like to work on writing stronger introductions. In my introductions, I have a hard time setting up my argument in a clear and effective way that draws the reader in. I tend to write general introductions, so I need to work on making a clear thesis in my introduction that allows the reader to instantly know the arguments to come further down the line in my essay. I would like to become stronger in writing introductions, since introductions are very important for setting up the rest of an essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Talilli Faleatua ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Talilli Faleatua]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106-01]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [10 February 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ In my writing, I focus mostly on the structure of my essays; I use a modified Schaffer method for paragraph structure. It is, typically, a five sentence structure that is as follows: topic sentence, concrete detail, two commentary sentences, and a concluding statement that relates to the main idea. If more details are needed, then a ratio of one-to-two should be implemented. As such, for every detail, there must be two commentary sentences. Typically, there should also be a transition with the addition of a new detail sentence. Depending on the subject of the essay and topic of the class, the concrete detail sentence may include a quote or paraphrase. In that case, the following commentary will be used to show my understanding, while the secondary comment will be an analytical view of the source material. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ In my recent essay from INTD 105, the Anthropocene, I modified the structure to fit the style, but the structure is still there. The essay was about "green" practices and personal barriers to them. In one of my paragraphs, my topic sentences, "I am also extremely sensitive to a lot of consumables. On top of my sensitivities, I also have dietary restrictions due to medical conditions.", contains a transitional phrase to create flow from the previous paragraph while both relay the main idea. The next sentence states a concrete detail about the topic, "I have to be very careful about what I eat and drink, which means that my options are very limited", that I further delve into with my commentary, "Often times, at the dining halls, I find that I can only safely eat some of the fruits or on-the-go items.

My AP European History class teacher really helped me construct a thesis that worked as a good introduction to my essay. This is a thesis I wrote back in September 2017 in the beginning of that class. "The Italian Renaissance brought a lot of change for better or for worse, but also, still had some continuity throughout the era." This just stated a very loosely what my essay was going to be about . My teacher told the class that a thesis statement has to explain why and be eye catching so readers want to keep reading your work. Flash forward to February 2018 my thesis got much better. "Otto Von Bismarck's government was influenced by a new type of conservatism by incorporating socialist ideals, open mindedness, and put the welfare of others first, but still followed conservative ideas." This thesis simply stated what is going to be talked about in the essay.

Getting evidence for my claim and explaining why it agrees with it. I believe this is an important technique because you have to prove your point when writing about something. If you do not prove your point then your writing then what you wrote will not be taken seriously and be credible. So whenever I am trying to make a point I try my best to explain and clarify so the reader understands what I am trying convey. When I was writing an Analysis paper I tried to credit my information as much as possible. For example, in my paper, I said "a long shot is used so that the audience can see Cosmo's emotion because they are able to see his whole body. The use of long shot is effective because during this part Cosmo is expressing his emotion with his whole body." I explained what I was trying to say. I just feel that is important to explain things when you write. This semester I want to focus on improving my grammar and organization skills.

This makes it wordy and cumbersome to read, and also unclear. Although I mentioned that the sinking of the Lusitania, it was unclear what "this" was about until you get to the very end. My freshman English teacher told us to, if possible, avoid using the same starting word more than once per page, and certainly not several times per page. After I finish editing and use many different starting words, my writing is clearer and reads more smoothly.

At first, I was confused why he thought that using the same word multiple times to start a sentence in a paragraph was bad. After speaking to him, he informed me that this was a problem because it created too much repetition. Too much repetition at the start of the sentence is bad because it makes readers feel as if they are being told the same statement over and over again.

According to Biko, the causes of Black inferiority were "white racism" and black acceptance of it (Hadfield 2017). White Racism, as stated by Biko, is the real problem because it is a common belief among the white population. This is because the white population in South Africa had special political, economic, and social privileges. Because of these special privileges, South African whites established a homogenous community and created justifications for their superiority. Leaders of the Black Consciousness Movement, most of the white population believed that the black population had accepted their inferiority in society (Hadfield 2017).

An example of this writing would be: "The electric current is the flow of electric charge which is carried by moving electrons in a wire. This was measured by using an ammeter." Then, when I take a second look at the writing I find there is a more complex way to piece these two sentences together. I would revise this by stating: "By using an ammeter, I was able to measure the electric current: the flow of electric charge carried by electron movement in a wire." Here I combined the simple, smaller sentence with another sentence to make the statement stronger and more complex. This adjustment automatically makes my writing stronger and fits the standards of a college lab write-up. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my time here at Geneseo, as well as in the future, I would like to better my writing by becoming proficient in analyzing texts. For example, in INTD 105 I am assigned to read a fictional novel and then analyze a certain quote from the text. I find it difficult to write solid evidence and analysis, and it feels as though I am simply summarizing the text. Maybe, my best option would be to write a line of evidence and then follow that line up with strong analysis. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jordan Eaton ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Jordan Eaton An aspect of my writing I consciously focus on is avoiding wordiness. I avoid using too many unnecessary or abstract words because it can distract the reader. When the reader is confused by my word choice, the impact of my claim is lessened, and my entire paper suffers. Additionally, wordiness can cause the reader to become bored with my writing. This can be detrimental to my paper because it is important to write for my audience and to keep readers engaged. I am much more confident in avoiding wordiness due to my last high school English class. Word choice and sentence economy are skills that I struggled with prior to this class, and my English teacher aided me in developing those skills. It took a better part of the school year to become confident in these writing skills, but with practice and guidebooks I believe I have a grasp on them. An example of improvement in my writing comes from a paper I wrote on global warming and capitalism. In my draft, a sentence read "It is impossible for capitalism to survive under the drastic and immediate changes needed to sufficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as clean energy, and the elimination of mass production for production's sake." This sentence contains a decent amount of wordiness that after proofreading I chose to revise. The sentence in my final paper instead read "Capitalism cannot survive under the drastic changes needed to sufficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions; including clean energy and the elimination of mass production." An aspect of my writing I want to improve on is clearer thesis statements and introductions. Beginning an essay is the most difficult part for me, and often times I find myself using overly generalized and bland statements. This can be frustrating for the reader, and is disadvantageous for my writing style. It is important to grab the attention of the reader while focusing on my argument, which is why this is something I think I need to work on. Maybe I can improve by rereading my introduction after completing my essay and make sure the introduction is clearly addressing the same point as the rest of my essay. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Donovan Dvorak ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Donovan Dvorak One aspect of academic writing that I believe I consciously focus on is using sound logic when conveying my points and making sure that those points are legitimate. For example, I thoroughly review my work to make sure that there are no loose ends or contradictions in the piece that I am writing. I think this is a highly important skill, because if your writing can not adequately show that your points are well thought out and add up correctly than your credibility as an author is lowered significantly. These skills have been developed while writing papers in the fields of psychology and political science. It is vital in these fields that your statistics and analysis demonstrate correct logical procedures and it has been ingrained in me the importance of reviewing to check for this. In a draft of a comparative politics essay that I was writing last semester (which was on gun culture in the United States), I recognized in my draft process that there were elements of the essay that I needed to change for the logic to make sense and for my claims to be valid arguments. Initially for evidence I had shown that other nations with a similar historical upbringing to the US had vastly different gun control laws mainly because of their development as nations. Then, realizing that this was not enough evidence to back my claim, I found and used contemporary statistics that showed that the use of deadly force in the United States. This data helped to further back my claim with both contemporary and historical data, thus further legitimizing my claims and demonstrating better logic (I had accounted for more factors). I believe that it is very important to work on writing skills as they are generally a good indicator of one's intellect. Through someone's writing you can understand to the degree that a person thinks and how detail oriented and understanding of a particular subject they are. In my writing some of the areas that need further development are my organization, use of metaphor, run on sentences, and balance between content in paragraphs. This semester I intend to read more literature outside of class so that I can expose myself to more writing. In return I believe I will be able to further understand what good writing looks like and how I can incorporate it into my own writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Olivia DuBois =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Olivia DuBois Self-Reflection \#1 While revising, or even writing my first draft, I try to focus on keeping my voice within the body of the text. I think that it's quite important to have elements of yourself in the writing, otherwise, is it truly yours? If you don't have any sort of connection to yourself or your own style of writing, isn't it practically just a generated slab of words? Word vomit is how some may describe it. You might as well just have an online generator write it for you if you're not going to insert yourself into the writing somehow. My twelfth grade AP English teacher always encouraged us to develop a certain "voice" in our pieces - even if it were just a short workshop writing piece. Throughout that course, I had seen a change in my work like never before. I even noticed my classmates' writing transforming. I greatly appreciated this teacher because otherwise, my writing would have remained as a formulated phrase or a boring network of nonsense. For example, I like to use metaphors or similes to keep my writing within a creative context. I think that using these writing devices help bring out a person's "voice" in writing because they usually relate back to a personal context. I also think that they help to define how a person may want to project themselves. In past essays, metaphor usage is very prominent such as "life passes by, it is the water flowing through rocks in a heavy creek; life goes on". I've also used a plethora of similes to describe certain things and almost paint a picture. I myself am a very optical person, so I like to use similes to complete the visualization. For progress in my following years at Geneseo, I hope to develop a better sense of efficient writing. I find that often times, I tend to take a long time to write. I also have a slight habit of run-on sentences. This, I would like to eliminate from my writing process so that it can be more concise. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hannah Dorn ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Hannah Dorn ]{lang="EN" style="margin: 0px;"} [Throughout my academic writing, while revising drafts of my papers, I try to focus on making sure that I state specific enough ideas in my introduction thesis and having that translate nicely over to my body paragraphs. What I mean by this is that I look at my introduction and[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}thesis to make sure that my statement is not to broad, and has specific details to back up my claim that I will be talking about, and add more context to keep it concise and to the point and not so strayed from the main point of the paper. My high school English teacher taught us that our papers always had to have a good hook to draw in the audience, and I always had the issue of rambling on, getting off track in the introduction and thus making my thesis confusing and hard to follow. So, I made it my goal to start narrowing in on my introduction paragraphs, and how I structured and supported my ideas so that it could be concise and easy for my reader to know what the goal of my paper was, and what my ideas were. An example of this is in the thesis of a [ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}paper that I wrote for my AP History class about the gay rights movement.

Until 8th grade, I really struggled with grammar. I did not know where to put commas, how to use semicolons or other advanced grammar rules. In 8th grade however, I went through " Grammar Boot Camp". In this 3 week long unit, we talked about everything there is to know about grammar from the basics to the advanced techniques. Ever since I completed this tiresome three weeks, I have consciously used these techniques and focused on them when writing and revising my papers. For example, I went from sentences such as " I am not good at writing. I need to take more english courses", to "I am not good at writing; I need to take more english courses". Although I just changed the period to a semi-colon, it makes quite a large difference in the complexity of the sentence. I think grammar is a very important aspect of writing. Without proper grammar, your paper will seem very improper and typically people will not want to read your work. On the other hand, if you can correctly place commas, semicolons, and utilize other advanced grammar rules, you will look like a sophisticated, intelligent writer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of my writing that I wish to improve this semester is my paragraphing and choice of words. I believe, like grammar, paragraphing is another important aspect in writing. With the correct paragraphing you can make papers sound overall more intelligent and more engaging. Sometimes I have trouble creating too many or too little paragraphs, wrongfully sorting ideas into categories. I hope through this class I can learn more about paragraph structure and learn to organize my ideas better. Word choice is another feature of my writing that I wish to improve on. Not only do I want to use a wider variety of complex words, but I want to try and find my own voice and style when I write. This will make my papers sound more interesting and compelling. These are two aspects of writing that I wish to improve on this semester.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tyler Dion ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} The aspect of academic writing I focus on when I revise my rough drafts is the flow of the writing. I try to make sure that my sentences flow together nicely especially when I do things such as pull in quotes or other types of outside information as I know that I do not do the best job of this. It is important in academic writing because it can easily ruin an essay if its hard to read or the sentences do not connect to one another. In the past with assignments such as research papers in high school teachers have pointed out where I have gone wrong and how to fix it. Sometimes it is simply as easy as making two sentences into one or putting one sentence in front of another. An example of this is making these two sentences "The colonists did not like their homes being used. The British officers were seen as intruders." Into one sentence like "The colonists did not like their homes being intruded by British officers." I feel writing skills are crucial in making a good clear argument, as no one will take your opinion seriously if you cannot word it properly. I could work more on proper grammar and formal writing as I am not very good at that. I write how I talk and tend to leave words like "very" or "really" a lot when it is not necessary. I could possibly work on this by having someone else proof read what I write, or by using other words in my writing that mean the same yet sound better. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Hannah DiLiberto ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I tend to put the most focus on sentence structure and diction. I try to keep sentences clear and concise and avoid run-on sentences. I like to use big words when I write in order to do that and it intrigues the reader when advanced vocab is used. I know not to just put every single word into a thesaurus to make my writing sound fancy, but it helps to get a point across in a clear manner. That was one of my main issues in high school when I\'d have to write papers. I would never know how to break up ideas that I had or how to structure sentences in order to portray exactly what I was thinking. An example would be \"The men were assigned roles and they were either a prisoner or a prison guard and as they played the roles more and more, they became the roles.\" My English teacher in high school said that this went on and on. It needed to be more concise. After reworking the essay, I changed it to \"As the men were given their roles as either a prisoner or prison guard, they rapidly conformed to them and lost themselves in the process.\" A skill that I would like to develop more in my writing is organization. When I am talking to someone, my thoughts tend to jump from one another and I ramble on a lot. This is apparent in my writing as well. When I write, I have so many ideas floating around in my head that I try to just get them down as quickly as possible so I do not forget them. I have tried to jot down ideas before I begin writing but I come up with new points to convey. As I take this course, I hope to develop a method of organizing my writing before I start writing an essay so that my ideas are not randomly thrown together, but instead flow nicely from one to another. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Tommy DeVito ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Tommy DeVito]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[\ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[February 8, 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When academically writing, I always focus on developing a strong thesis statement. A strong thesis consists of a sentence starting with the main idea, followed by three or more points that will support the main idea. Each point will be used in a body paragraph, connecting the points to the main idea. Throughout my high school English and College Research classes, my teachers always stressed having a strong thesis statement included in my introduction. This is because the the thesis consists of building blocks to a well written paper. When writing, looking back at my thesis statement has always allowed me to stay on track, and focus my writing on the main idea. I can tell if I have created a strong thesis if I am able to trace each body paragraph back to the main idea stated. An example of a three point thesis would be, "Dogs are great family pets because you can train them, children enjoy them, and they are fun to play with." This thesis gives the main idea that dogs are great family pets, and three points that will support it throughout the paper. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I would like to improve my sentence structure. Forming better sentences will allow my writing to sound more fluent, and better express my ideas. Currently, I struggle with putting my ideas into well formed sentences. This year, I would like to further develop my skills in sentence structure because I feel that my writing is not always appealing to the reader. I often find my sentences to be choppy and they don't flow as easily as I intend them to. Better sentence structure will allow my papers to further interest the reader in what I have to say. By the end of this course, after thoroughly reading through the modules and completing the quizzes, I hope to change this flaw in my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Morgan DePue ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I am writing, I am always sure to put emphasis on balance of the major topics that I am including in the piece. I usually stick to three to five main ideas that translate themselves into three to five paragraphs. I strive to make these paragraphs organized and relatively the same length. I do not want to be rambling about a main point for an entire page where I have another idea that only contributes a couple of sentences to the essay I am writing. The skill of balance is important because I prefer my readers being engaged instead of dragging on my ideas with long paragraphs or falling short in the delivery of information with shorter paragraphs. I recently submitted a project about A2 milk, which is real cows' milk with a difference in protein compared to ordinary milk. The advisor that evaluated my work appreciated that I spent 40% "priming" my readers with background information and 60% of the piece discussing the benefits of A2 milk. She stated that I had a proper balance of my content because if my work was divided 50-50 then my readers may have been confused as to what the bulk of my content was. As I further my career as a student at SUNY Geneseo, I would like to craft more clear and concise introductory statements. In past pieces of work, I notice my topic paragraphs are a bit confusing and it does not inform my reader what they will be exactly reading about. To fix this, I write an introductory paragraph, write my essay and then go back to my introductory statements and make sure the main ideas match up with what I discussed in my body paragraphs. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grace Dempsey =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} My 12th grade creative writing teacher taught me the importance of a strong hook, and ever since, it is what I focus on most closely in all of my work. As I write papers, I focus on creating a hook in the introduction that will grab readers attention and stand by it throughout my entire paper. I make sure when I write my introduction, it makes sense with the rest of my work, while keeping the readers drawn in. I exemplify this well in an article I recently wrote about Jonas Mekas, a filmmaker who created in the Avant-Garde era. In my introduction, I said, "Jonas Mekas was amongst many famous filmmakers who decided to take part in this exploratory time in American history. He used personal hardships from his childhood to channel his inventive side and created abstract films using his reworked aesthetic of home movies that expanded the understanding of film and what it meant to him." After creating this hook, I went into more detail in the following paragraphs about his childhood and hardships, and how they shaped his creative ability to make a powerful film. [ ]{.Apple-converted-space} I would really like to expand on my explanations after stating a quotation. I feel it is important to not only introduce and cite a quote, but also to explain it.

In high school, one of my English teachers enforced the idea of not repeating information (unless it is used to enforce a certain topic) and condensing my thoughts to fit a page restriction. I was always the student who would write seven pages, when the requirement was suppose to be four pages. In high school I always felt that I need to be passive with my writing and express every meticulous detail about an explanation to get my point across, which usually lead me to exceeding the page requirement. A piece of advice I was given was to try to stay focused on the assignment and take out anything that might drift from the main point of the essay. An example of this is "According to John Steinbeck, agrarianism is an essential topic expressed in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Grapes of Wrath]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[. According to the novel, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Grapes of Wrath]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ agrarianism is expressed widely throughout the story of the Joad family and their experiences with life outside of their rural lifestyle in Oklahoma after the Dust Bowl destroyed their property." I realize that I could have made this thought into one sentence, and that it was unneccessary to use "According to" twice while explaining one thought. I could have came up with a different introduction to the following sentence. When I went back and revised the essay, I condensed the sentences to "In John Steinbeck's ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[The Grapes of Wrath]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[, agrarianism is a topic expressed throughout the struggles of the Joad family, as they try to find work after the damage left by the Dust Bowl." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward, I would like to concentrate on expanding my vocbulary. I think that a large vocabulary in a peice of writing not only makes it more enjoyable to read, but enjoyable to write. In my writing I feel that I repeate the same words over and over again. I also feel like I do not use some words properly if I do try to expand my vocabulary.

I think it Is important to have clear sentences, so you can get your point across. I have been told by my mom that reading what you write outload is very helpful. My INTD 105 teacher this semester reiterated this idea to help me with my writing. In a recent paper in INTD 105 describing what I can do to help the environment I wrote "I feel that I can't do much just by myself, so I can do as much as possible to shut down fossil fuel giants and limit the use of plastic and paper, so everyone can use energy that doesn't hurt the environment". A more clear version of this sentence would be " I have little direct impact on the earth, so indirect methods such as shutting down fossil fuel giants is the only way to make a difference". I feel that I need to work on writing for quality rather than quantity. I get too caught up in getting the exact amount of words suggested and then write more. This leads me to have wordy sentences and long sentences. They tend to not make much sense too. I thank you for having a wide range of words, so I do not have to feel like I have to force words. Also, I need to connect my ideas better and have stronger evidence to support those ideas. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Scott Dannenberg ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I tend to focus on the facts when writing my papers. I first try to get all of my facts and quotations down then afterwards weave these different things into a coherent essay. I think that this helps me keep organized and I can pretty much give this form of writing to my third grade teacher when he first taught us how to write DBQs, while I don't exactly have my third grade DBQs anymore, more recent papers show this form of writing. For example, if I were to write about World War II, I would write down "Over 8 million Soviet soldiers and over 5 million Nazi soldiers would be killed." the I would attempt to form a line with "The loss of life of WWII's eastern from totalled over 8 million Soviet soldiers and 5 million Nazi soldiers, this loss of life was unseen anywhere else in this war."

When I go through the revision process I tend to highlight words that I find myself using too often, make a note of it, go back and use synonyms in order to replace repetitive language. For example, in previous papers I would use words like; "many, understand, before, etc," quite often. In order to incorporate more sophisticated language to substitute those words, I kept a separate tab open on my laptop so that I was able to look up synonyms for words I used all the time.

When it comes to my essay writing however, I struggle the most with capturing the essence of the paper when writing the conclusion. I find it hard to gather all the main points and restate the thesis without sounding either too repetitive or like I do not understand the concept of what I wrote the essay on. I can acknowledge the fact that a conclusion is a crucial aspect of any essay because it is the last thing a person remembers. It is important to insure that the person reading your essay is able to comprehend everything that is mentioned and the best way to make sure that happens is through a well constructed conclusion.

No matter the topic being discussed, the person reading your work should be engaged. A high school English teacher of mine told me that in any essay you write, it's necessary to tell a story. When writing a paper, my focus is always on keeping the reader informed and active in the themes I am relaying to them. Specificity is what attracts the reader and allows them to paint a picture of the information. This also gives people the chance to make a personal connection to the essay. The way you present information by not boring your reader makes the biggest differences in my writing. I consistently find words that are bland and swap in descriptive words that give the reader a better understanding of the mentioned experience. I ensure that if I was a reader with no knowledge of the topic, I could still comprehend what was being said because it was specific and descriptive. This applies to any type of writing; it could be a personal narrative, a persuasive essay, or any response that needs to be full of detail with description to tell the story. Whatever it may be, my motive as a writer is to not leave my reader questioning or uninterested. It is always understandable if the topic being discussed is not the most interesting, however, them making any connection that they didn't have before reading is successful in my eyes. For instance, when writing college essays, one sentence was, "My passion for dance is what has shaped my character." Although this gets my point across, it doesn\'t not grasp the attention of the reader. Instead, the sentence could be, "Dance has the ability to take me to a new place that makes my body feel at home and provides the comfort I need." This gives more detail and a sense of emotion that will allow a reader to make the connection of what their own passions might be. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like my writing to have an emphasis on my conclusions and their ability to effectively wrap up my argument or topic in a clear and coherent way.

Instead of simplifying things that don't need to be simplified, I would instead redirect that skill to a part of my essay that needs to be simplified. Some guidance that I had that helped me stop oversimplifying things in my essay was my writing teacher in high school; he helped me see that the things that I should spend my time simplifying is complex words and phrases.

It merely astonishes me," is saying that Zora feels uncomfortable around white people, I could analyze this quote further by saying that even though Zora feels uncomfortable by the white people in her school, she didn't let that stop her from accomplishing everything she wanted to accomplish.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I want to develop effectively for my writing at Geneseo is adding more voice into my writing. I think that being able to include voice in my writing would make my writing sound a bit more put together and unique. I feel intimidated when trying to add voice in my writing because I don't know how to do it correctly.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Trent Thomas ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As a writer, I would say one of my main strong suits is my ability to plan my paper before I write it. Before I start a paper, I take a couple days before I write it to figure out how I am going to lay out my paper. I list out specific points that I want to make on the paper prior to writing it, allowing me to have my thoughts organized before even starting the paper. Following that, I do research on possible quotes I can use to help support the main point I am trying to make in an essay.I credit two people for helping me focus on organization. My AP English teacher in high school and my father stressed to me all throughout my senior year of high school that organization is a key part to good paper writing. By doing this I am able to focus on other parts of my essay that otherwise wouldn't be completely addressed. Examples of this is making sure I am using professional language, and minimizing grammar mistakes. My method of organization does not only apply to essays, but applies to formal emails I have to send as well. In high school, I was enrolled in an Independent Research program, in which I had to conduct my own experiment and have a college professor mentor me during the project. When requesting a college recommendation, it was very important that I made sure my language was formal, and concise. I organized the email into three specific categories including, application deadlines, resume builders, and uploading to the Common App. I wrote, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The process for getting the recommendation letter is as follows: Prof. Baldridge should upload to the \"Common App\" which is the system that students use to apply for colleges. Once it is in, I can then select the institutions to receive it. My school guidance counselor and I entered Prof. Baldridge\'s email address into the system and a link should have been sent to Prof. Baldridge where she would have instructions on how to upload."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While writing, I need to focus on what vocabulary I am using. One of my weaknesses tends to be that my writing is not as interesting as it could be. I tend to repeat words instead of finding synonyms I can use instead. By improving my vocabulary, I will be able to engage more readers.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Connor Thayer =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing in an academic setting, I focus consciously on my thesis statement, because it gives me the guidance needed for the rest of my paper. I believe the thesis statement is the most important part of academic writing, because it not only tells the reader what will be written about in the rest of the paper, but while writing it, it helps me stay on task and gives me a map of what I will write about. During eleventh grade, my English teacher took two full weeks of class time to focus on writing thesis statements, which emphasized the true importance of being able to set up the entire paper. We learned many different templates and styles of thesis statements, and because the focus was placed on them for a long period of high school, I will not forget them. An example of one of my stronger thesis statements in an argumentative paper is, "While some people argue that palliative care is wrong and inhumane due to the connotation that it promotes death, it is clear that palliative care is needed and helpful, as evidenced by the increased quality of life, which includes less pain for the patient, more happiness, and an overall positive experience of death." With this thesis statement, the entire paper is planned out, as I went on with a paragraph about the counterclaim, and three more paragraphs about decreased pain, increased happiness, and a positive outlook on death. This skill can be applied to many types of writing, and I believe it is the most important piece of every paper. As I write at Geneseo and beyond, I would like to concentrate on the length of my papers. I find myself writing much more than what is needed, which adds "fluff" to my writing. While sometimes this is okay, most of the time I need to be more concise with what I need to say. I feel that I often take two sentences to write about a thought that should only be in one. If I can focus on this aspect of writing, I will be able to write more effectively, and the reader will much better understand my work, creating a much better overall piece of writing. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Al Tejera ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect that I tend to focus on is the detail and fluidity of words in my pieces. I am creative, and that translates back into my work. I end up using story-like words and elements to engage the reader. I prefer to have a conversation (or tell them an anecdote) with the reader rather than writing bland facts. However, teachers in the past have disliked this way of writing since it isn\'t as concise as an academic paper should be. I learned that I can still keep my own words while reframing them in to a more readable structure. To illustrate, instead of vague phrases such as \"Sin has always been an interesting concept from all of humanity since the beginning of time\", I rephrased it to say, \"]{style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"}[The Elephant Vanishes]{style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"}[, a collection of short stories, by Haruki Murakami works to show that sin can lead to the downfall of humanity\". The poetic nature of the first sentence is wordy.

Sometimes I feel elementary in this area. For example, I do tend to use contractions in my writing. Also, I\'d to lessen the informality of pieces through the elimination of such language and the learning of new words to expand my vocabulary for academic writing. Perhaps, through this course I can revise my works to make them sound more professional. ]{style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"} <div> </div> ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Victoria Taylor ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} During my revision process, my main focus is on making sure the paper I am writing flows. I think about this the most because it is important to stay on one topic at a time and thoroughly explain the point brought up before moving onto another. Also, the topics need to relate to one another otherwise the paper would be all over the place and not make sense. At times I've had to change entire points in my paper due to the fact they did not make sense in the context they were in. During my high school career, my eleventh grade English teacher helped revise papers written in her class very strictly and harshly. This method she uses help me to have my writing make sense and go with the original topic and not get too off track. Writing a reflection about the book "Columbine" I went back and forth between discussing the emotional and logistics of the event. At first, I wanted to do them together, but the points I had did not mesh well with one another. After writing my entire paper, my teacher advised me to change most of they idea in it because it didn't go with the other. I ended up just writing about the logistics of the event and having to fine new points. Because of this fix my paper went together smoothly and now made sense.\ One aspect of writing I would like to develop from Geneseo is the diction I use in my writing. I have always struggled with my word choice and how to make my words come out eloquently and thoughtful. During this course I hope to improve my savviness with my words to make the reader more enthralled. Doing this I know I must expand my vocabulary to help better the words I choose. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gabriella Tandoi ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Within my writing, I already focus on analyzing textual evidence. I believe I am very good at taking evidence from a piece of literature and putting into my own words to support a central theme. It is important to develop a strong thesis and to be able to support that thesis with textual evidence. In my high school English classes, my teachers focused on the importance of analyzing and putting as much as you can into your own words. This made it easier for me to actually understand what I was reading to create a solid paper. I was taught how to develop a strong thesis and to back it up with strong evidence. An example of good analyzing skills from a piece of my work is in my latest essay about the African American experience in twentieth century America. In this example I am analyzing a quote from Zora Neale Hurston's essay, "How it Feels to be Colored Me." I wrote, "Before she left her little town in Florida she had not seen a difference of people who were not the same color. She did not feel sorrow for being black, because she believed the strong would be successful regardless of skin color." In response to the quote, "I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation, more or less"(Hurston, 115). In this example I have clearly analyzed textual evidence with also providing some insight. In my future I would like to focus on my transitioning skills. I always create strong sentences to support my thesis and my analyzing, but my transitioning to different paragraphs need work. I would like to focus on inserting my own opinion more fluidly into my work as well. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alyssa Tunnera ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Alyssa Tunnera]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My Writing Priorities]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of the aspects I focus on most in my writing is to make sure that my sentences flow and don't sound awkward. Throughout high school, the one factor of writing that I always struggled with was wording a sentence correctly without it sounding too fragmented. My English teachers would always tell me that the ideas in my sentences were good, but that I needed to work on my structure and wording so that it was easier to read. I think that I can continue to revise my work to have one smooth paragraph by heeding advice from my senior year English teacher. He had given me an essay back that had more than a few awkward sentences in it and gave me the advice to always read my essays out loud to myself before turning them in. If a sentence is difficult to read out loud, he encouraged me to attempt to reword the sentence in a clearer and more concise way. An example of a sentence that I changed is "The movement brought about a theme of searching for a voice and recognizing the self worth that black South Africans were being forced to repress for so many years." After reading this sentence out loud, I realized that it didn't read as smoothly as I had wanted. I reworded it to instead say "The movement brought about a theme of black South Africans finding their voices. They began to recognize their self worth, despite being forced to repress it for many years." By splitting my original sentence into two sentences, my point became much clearer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect that I would like to focus on more in my writing is expressing my voice. In my writing, I tend to use a lot of quotes in my writing and the author of the quotes' voice overshadows my own voice. I think I would benefit from only using quotes that are necessary to prove my point, instead of using quotes to fill in a paragraph when I don't know what to write. I can try to explain my thoughts on other people's quotes to put some input of my own voice back into my writing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jack D\'Errico ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The part of my writing that I spent the most time on improving was learning how to structure my writing. I put most of my time improving this aspect because when an essay has a solid structure it is easy for the reader to follow and see your perspective on the topic. If a writer doesn't plan their writing out beforehand, then the reader is going to become confused and not take anything from your writing. Back in high school, one of my teachers produced his own original outline to help his students in their writing. The outline consisted of different sections representing different paragraphs. Each section would consist of a main topic, supporting details and quotes if necessary. Also, it helped organize each thought as well as combined thoughts that are similar enough to discuss in the same paragraph. After using this outline I quickly realized that being able to organize your thoughts can really change the outcome of your writing. An example would be that before using this outline I would clump too many thoughts into one, which lead to a lot of things going on in my writing. However, after putting all my thoughts through the outline my writing began to be more clear and easier to follow. Thanks to one of my high school teachers I learned how to organize my writing and help my words flow more fluently for the reader. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [A part of my writing that I want to improve on is being more creative and expanding my vocabulary. I feel as though I could use more intuitive words to help reach out to the reader more effectively. The reader can get bored if the writer just uses the same bland words throughout the whole essay. However, by spicing up each sentence in a new way it will keep the reader more engaged and enjoy the reading. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jessica D\'Antonio ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write I focus on incorporating my own knowledge into the written piece to further elaborate and provide support for resources I have quoted. I believe that in doing this it illustrates that I am not trying to be contingent upon sources and other authors to support my argument. In high school, many of my teachers stressed the importance of justifying and explaining quotes or evidence from outside resources. In doing so, we provide our readers with an understanding of why the quote was chosen and how it enhances our argument. For instance, I would first introduce the quote with a statement that makes a claim: "Semele was killed due to the radiant light created by Zeus as he transformed into his true self." Then I would state the quote: "Semele requested that Zeus show himself in "complete magnificence, in your unabridged brilliance...so that I may love you without limit." (Everett 16) After stating the quote, I wrote a statement to provide support for that quote and to help convey the use of it for my argument: "*Frenzy*conveys that Zeus did indeed kill Semele, however, it was not out of anger or because of a lie she had allegedly told, but on account of his love for her." As I continue my education at Geneseo, I would like to focus more on how to create a voice in my writing. I believe that having a voice will help create a more relatable writing style. Developing a voice also gives your writing a personality. In addition, I believe that having a strong voice establishes consistency and helps grab your readers' attention which is exactly what I want my writing to do.

Some of the ways I try to improve this aspect is by reading other works and doing certain exercises to help my writing sound more sophisticated. Grammar is a very important skill in the basics of making essays, letters, even notes. I think it is very important to be able to write appropriately especially with being a biology major, if I decide to go to med school. Grammar is really going to play a natural role in that type of profession path. I think if I start paying attention and improving those skills now it is going to pay off in the long run. This is going to be the most important aspect I will try to be improving over these next couple months in my writing. By taking the skepticism/ conspiracy theories section we will be taking in the past, present, and future context and be using new vocabulary and diction which will further my knowledge in the English language. For example a quote where my grammar was poor and was very redundant was \"Low income school districts have the lowest graduation rate and the highest drop out rate, and wealthier districts have the highest graduation rate have the lowest drop out rate.\" This quote was withdrawn from my Soc 100 class for my rough draft on my final paper. I revised this quote by just making it simpler saying \" School districts with higher income tends to be correlated with higher graduation rates. In the future, I would like to make my writing more concrete and basic then trying to be sophisticated and making no sense. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Connor Curley =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus on the key points when writing, I emphasize as if it were a persuasion piece. I am good at bringing up points and relating them to one another. From previous writing tasks I know, I have done a par job of using this strategy. I find success in using transition terms as I move from one point to the next. Such as, however, therefore, for example. These help me analyze my writing and the points in discussing. If I\'m analytical about my points it makes it easier for the reader to find meaning. For me, this method helps me stay on track while being able to dive deep into the material. I found this methodology apparent in one of my philosophy papers. The task was to apply ethics to a doctors case on patient confidentitlity between a husband and wife. [ ]{.Apple-tab-span}The medical health professional is undoubtedly torn between what\'s morally right and the duty of his job. However, in this case, I strongly believe that the doctor has a duty of care to both these patients. He must inform Anna in order to provide her with the care she deserves and to avoid any possible health complications.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space}Jose was going to give his wife unsubscribed pills to treat the STD, with plans to never really tell her that she may be infected. If the doctor were to condone such treatment from Jose then it would be an act of negligence and a breach of the duty of care. I give my stance on the case early and I apply ethics to the decision. Throuought I use transition words and reasoning for my stance. In the future, I would like to better my organization skills. I tend to type it as it comes, rather than formulate a set plan. Doing this I run into simple grammatical errors and often make it difficult for a reader to truly understand. I know that a greater sense of organization would increase my writing ability tremendously.

I always like to be sure I have a hook at the beginning of my paragraphs to draw the reader in and give a little insight as to what will be addressed in the paper. I have a wide imagination, so coming up with catchy sentences or an intriguing first liner has never been something I struggle with. For instance, when prompted with writing about myself from the perspective of a stranger, I open with, "Sitting in the nearest Starbucks, a man rushes past me, splashing the foamy contents of his cup in all surrounding areas, except, of course, his finely pressed suit, and stares blankly at the coffee stains settling into my tie-dyed tee-shirt, dripping onto my fuzzy slippers." Another priority of mine is to utilize different words. I try my best to stray from the basics, but sometimes run into trouble when I try to find synonyms and end up with a chunk of words that I cannot even pronounce. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Going forward, I want to expand my vocabulary so I am able to find words that flow lyrically down the page.

Throughout my high school career, I was drilled into correctly citing my sources and using my sources judiciously. It was important to my teachers, and to myself, to give credit to the sources I used when credit was due. Additionally, I learned how to weave sources in and out of my papers, so I was able to show my opinion and support it with other people's opinions or facts. This enhances the material I have written and includes additional information that strengthens my essay. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [There are still many ways I can develop my skills of academic writing regarding my inclusion of sources. The more I write, the better I will become at introducing and using sources in my paper more fluently. By focusing on this skill, my writing will become more direct to the audience I am writing for. Many of my teachers have helped me develop this skill and I'm thankful for all their guidance and persistence. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One example of using sources correctly and with good judgement was an essay I wrote about the electoral college.

A portion of my essay is shown below: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [The Electoral College overrepresented rural states due to the system of favoring less populated states over more populated states. Some states may carry one third of another state\'s vote, such as Florida compared to South Dakota (\"Arguments against the Electoral College.\"). The Electoral College also fails to represent third parties in this aspect, too. According to Gilder Lehrman, "a third-party or independent candidate were to win the support of even as many as 25% of the voters nationwide, he might still end up with no Electoral College votes at all unless he won a plurality of votes in at least one State. And even if he managed to win a few States, his support elsewhere would not be reflected." The Electoral College not only correlates with depression in voting, it also does not accurately represent the views of America and neglects independent or a third-party.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [(Word Count: 366)]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Victoria Creviston ================================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Victoria Creviston\ INTD 106\ Self Reflection \#1 I am someone who likes to write. When I write, whether it\'s poetry essays or even just simple responses as to this one, the one thing I always struggle with is how to start and end. I always know the information I want to focus on, and usually can brainstorm and map my thoughts sequentially which helps me explain narratives. However, for the life of me, I cannot properly start or conclude any kind of essay or written work. It\'s important that when writing a paper or a response or whatever it may be, that it starts in a way that people actually want to read it, and adjourns in a way that the reader feels like they understand what they have read and concisely have their last thoughts wrapped up and neatly and in a way that I feel ends. This is something I don\'t seem to be capable of. Whenever I write I always feel like there are loose ends that haven\'t been tied up. Things left unresolved or unexplained that don\'t allow me to fully express the thoughts or emotions behind the writing. Pieces missing. Junior year, I was very close to my English teacher. She helped me through a lot emotionally by teaching me how to understand my thoughts and feelings through writing. Though I still struggle when writing in my spare time, I know there are people I can reach out to for help with my writing such as many if the people in the writing department here, as well as my teachers back home if I\'m stuck. Since coming to Geneseo, I have been able to take the time I need to write passionately and effectively. With more time to write and more time to explore my thoughts through writing, I continue to re-fall in love with writing over and over again.

One skill I have worked on extensively over the course of my writing career is the ability to restructure my sentences in order to exclude words such as "that." I worked on this skill very specifically in my senior year English class; especially as I was writing my high school thesis. My teacher Mr. Rapp would read us examples of sentences and ask us how to fix them. He told us, "often times, you can say what you want with very few words." I utilized this skill all throughout my thesis. Rather than saying statements such as, "The important thing is that high school athletes where helmets that protect their heads," I would revise to "It is important for high school athletes to wear protective head gear during play." In this way I would get the same point across, while using far less "fill" words, and unnecessary sentence length. In terms of my academic writing, the skill of eliminating "fill" words in my writing has greatly improved my writing and scores. I have found that this small skill is an easy way to make my writing appear more professional. Going into college this skill helped me immensely in my 200-level history course, where I had to write countless academic essays. Despite this acquired skill, however, I still require much improvement throughout my writing. One skill I would like to improve on is my ability to clearly transition from paragraph to paragraph. I often struggle with connecting my conclusion sentences to the following paragraphs, and with making my essays flow. When I receive my essay grades from professors, there are always comments on my paragraph transitions. I believe if I can master this skill, my essays will be more professional and easier to follow. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Daniella Cornelia =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing I already focus on consciously as I revise my drafts is making sure I\'m not constantly repeating myself. A lot of time in a paper or even an email I will say the same thing but in a different way and my papers can get repetitive. In high school, we were assigned paper with a certain page minimum that we would have to reach and I feel as though I have became repetitive because I was often just short of the page requirement. As I grew as a writer I have noticed it more and more and have got help from my English teachers. For example, the other day I wrote an email to my professor asking if I could come in to meet with them about a question I had on one of the homework they had assigned. "I would like to meet up with you to go over the homework. I don't understand the homework because it is more intense then the questions in class, can I come in to meet you?" Instead I could of just say "I'm having trouble with the homework, is there anyway I can come in to go over it with you?" One aspect I want to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo and beyond is citing and using citations. I feel as though even though I know how to do it, every time I write a paper I get nervous if I did it correctly or not. Also quoting from the resource. I need to work on explaining the quotes and not just putting them in my essay just to put them in.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jordan Cooper =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Throughout my writing career I have always had trouble completing my argument or thought upon first writing. My editing process usually consists first of rereading my original drafts and rephrasing or adding a sentence to better complete the idea that I presented. On the high school level, my teachers would comment that following revision, my arguments were much clearer, and more concise, often due to elevated diction or better phrasing. One example in which I was able to use this skill in editing my writing was throughout a high school paper discussing the negative effects of illegally downloading of music. I originally stated, "The rise of online music providers has stripped many musicians of a fair share of their money" yet following my revision process I was able to create a stronger statement saying, "The technological advancements of the modern era have made it absurdly easy for the public to obtain music for free, leaving the artist with no profit." Another example is when comparing George Orwell's *1984*, and Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, I began with saying "In both books it is obvious there is so much wrong with both worlds, but the people of each world have no idea that there is any bad and wouldn't dare to look past the censored kaleidoscope they see through" which became "Both stories exist in corrupt dystopian societies with the majority of the characters preferring to stay ignorant to the dishonesty of their worlds." In both cases, there is a clear difference in terms of intellect and formality between my original argument and the revised version. Without focusing on the clarity and intellect aspect of my arguments, I would hold less merit as a writer and my reader would be less likely to agree with what I put forth. One aspect of my writing that I would like to improve in would be to more effectively anticipate and refute any disagreements that a reader or skeptic may have with the stance or topic I am discussing. Being able to acknowledge a difference in opinion or disinterest in the topic yet giving the reader a compelling reason to continue on reading is a great skill to have as a writer. I believe that being able to obtain this skill may better my writing considerably. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christopher Cook ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus a lot on making sure I don\'t use first-person pronouns, such as I or my, in a lot of my essays due to a lot of my essay\'s being argumentative or research based, compared to a reflection or opinion based response. I do this because it detaches your opinion from what you\'re writing. This helps me when writing an argumentative essay as it helps to remove any bias from my argument by keeping everything third person. In a research paper or lab report for science it keeps everything third person as that was how the professors preferred it and they said it was more professional for sake of repeating any experiments. An example of something that I had to change during one of my reports while reviewing it was changing the sentence from \"We had taken the aqueous solution and we had put it in the beaker.\" to \"The aqueous solution was then put into the beaker\". As a result of this, the sentence is more professional in a scientific setting as it just states the steps and doesn\'t include any first person pronouns. Within the future I would like to be able to elaborate more on sources that I use instead of just using their quotes and then moving on. I would like to start using quotes, and then elaborating on those quotes by connecting them to the rest of the essay and explaining how the quote supports my given thesis. I believe this would be more beneficial than just using the quote to support my thesis without providing any additional information to go along with the quote. If I were to do this when writing an argumentative essay, I would be giving my thesis even more support by breaking down exactly how the given piece of evidence supports my thesis. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kathryn Connell ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I consciously focus on maintaining a steady balance between quoted sections and original sections in papers. I strive to have a solid amount of evidence, but making sure the quoted evidence doesn't outweigh the actual body of my essay. I received feedback that I used to use too many quotes in my essays, and began to paraphrase more and include more original thoughts that stem from the evidence I have found. One example of this is an Issue Profile I had to create for my Sociology class last semester, which ended up being mostly quoted material. I showed it to my TA, who helped me see where I could cut out unnecessary information and add my own information and thoughts on the topic. It's important to quote sources to avoid plagiarism, but also important to make sure quoted sources aren't becoming the majority of the paper, clouding the individual unique thoughts in it. I enjoy learning new skills that can improve my writing. I could develop better by trying to cut down on the amount of transition words (then, next, therefore, also) that I use in essays. I tend to overuse transition words as filler in essays, and need to stop this bad habit. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emma Colson ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Emma Colson In writing, the aspect I prioritize over all others is being engaging. Our generation seems to be afflicted with ADD. And, when you add to that all the things competing for our attention, such as Netflix, twitter, snapchat, and YouTube, it has become necessary for writers to earn the attention of readers. I think of writing as a contract with the reader. The reader agrees to read what I write, and I agree not to bore him or her with my writing. Since as long ago as I can remember, my dad has helped me with my writing. I have always valued this because he's an experienced author. Many times after reading the first two paragraphs or so of my writing he will say, "Emma, you're not gripping me!" He views the engagement aspect as a writer's life-or-death obligation. An example of how I incorporated this mentality into my writing is in a piece I wrote for a theater class during the intercession. I wrote, "And just when they think the pain and torture is over from the boat, they enter a whole new hell." After discussing it with my dad, I revised that sentence to read, "And, just when they thought the misery from the boat had come to an end, as they reached land, they entered a whole new dimension of hell." I am always surprised at how changing just a few words can alter the flavor of a sentence or paragraph. As I evolve as a writer, I hope to improve my organizational style. An undisciplined piece of writing can be death to my "earn their attention" mentality. Why? Because readers get bored easily and nothing is more boring that a writer who cannot seem to get to the point in a logical way. My problem is that I don't outline enough, and it results in writing that can be repetitive and disorganized. Throughout this course, I intend to begin with more thorough outlines and completing multiple drafts until the piece is as engaging and organized as possible. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katherine Collins =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} As a history major, the vast majority of the academic writing I do is based heavily on research and facts. Therefore, vocabulary and terms related to the subject are extremely important. A strength I have in academic writing is that I am able to make my paper dense in facts and key terms that are specific to the topic of that paper. In order to set these types of papers up, a strong thesis is needed to clearly convey the topic of the paper to the reader. In many cases, the reader may not know a lot about the topic, so it is important to have a specific set up providing background knowledge for the reader. For example, last semester I had to write about the post-apartheid era for one of my history final papers. In order to set up the reader for my essay, I could have said "The post-apartheid era was a time when many changes took place". However, that thesis was lacking key terms and details. My final thesis was, "The post-apartheid era in South Africa was a time meant for changes to be made so that South Africa could move forward as a country, especially after the segregationist ideals and legislation put in place during apartheid." This thesis was stronger and included the key terms such as "segregationist ideals and legislation", "apartheid", and "South Africa". One area in academic writing that I want to work on is getting better at the Chicago Manual Style (CMS). This is the primary style of writing and citations that is used in history. In high school, I used the MLA format. Using CMS is fairly new to me, and I want to grow in my ability to use that format. I also want to incorporate signal phrases more into my writing. This would help clearly show where I am quoting, paraphrasing, and summarizing in addition to the citation. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Morgan Coll ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I feel as though I am a strong writer. I won a bunch of scholarships in high school due to writing essays. I tend to be pretty good at writing for long periods of time continuously although this is a problem at times. The reason for this is because it creates run on sentences which I know isn't the best thing to do while writing essays. I try to focus on where I can end the sentences and create new ones while having it still make sense. Usually I take out the "because" or the "and then" and replacing it with and period and then starting a new sentence. Another problem I struggle with is thinking people understand what i'm talking about throughout my writing. I use to words it and they and them when these people who are reading my work probably don't know who I'm referring to. also One example that I have of this would be in one of the essays I wrote for a scholarship my senior year of high school. "I can relate to them because, that was me once, I just couldn't afford it, but now that I have played throughout high school I know skills and have a lot more experience." As you can see this sentence was just way too long and to chance it I would do the following.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ["I can relate to them because that was me once. I just couldn\'t afford to play soccer anymore due to financial struggles. Now that I have played throughout high school, I know more skills and have a lot more experience ."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [By me taking out one sentence and replacing it with three, it takes away the problem of the run on sentence. I also changed the it to play soccer which made readers understand what i was talking about more. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While at Geneseo I would like to improve my vocabulary and use stronger words and differently word so i wouldn\'t repeat the same words over and over. In this essay i have used the same word "which" at least three times. So that's what I would like to improve here at Geneseo!]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Robert Colbath ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, and especially during the revision process, I tend to focus on developing a voice while remaining professional. It is easy to list facts in the standard claim, support, explain format, but in upper level writing courses I have learned that effective writing incorporates voice. While I think using your voice in an essay properly is challenging, if done correctly it takes the paper to the next level. My high school English teachers reminded me that voice is not just blatantly stating "in my opinion" or "I think", but lies in diction and phrasing. For example, rather than saying "the author wants to convey how women influence each other", I write, "It is abundantly clear the influence the other women have one another; installing sensitivity, camaraderie, and strength". I feel as though using stronger vocabulary helps make writing more influential. However, a strong voice does not necessarily mean strong vocabulary, but also requires engaging the reader in the actual writing. Without directly addressing the audience as "you", it is possible to acknowledge what they are thinking and provide an explanation; for example, "This may seem insignificant, but in the context, it is clear Young intends to make the point that this woman, and all women, are as important as men". In this quote, I have addressed that the quote used beforehand may seem of little significance, but once delved into, hold tremendous importance. Both examples of my past writing display that effective voice is often achieved by stating opinions as facts, meaning that you must believe and have evidence to back up that observations are, in fact, accurate.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An aspect I hope to improve upon throughout my time at Geneseo is being more concise in my writing. I think I often focus too much on my vocabulary, which results in the meaning of the sentence getting lost between all of the commas and terms. While this is not always a downfall of my writing, being able to clearly and effectively state a claim and explain it would be much more time efficient and give me a better quality essay overall. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Carolyn Coffed ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on being concise in my writing. I try to say as much as I can using as few words possible. This is important because it makes the writing easier to read and understand and it forces the writer to be more precise with their word choice (there will be fewer but more impactful words). My dad and 10th grade English teacher are two people who have helped me be more conscious of concision. When my dad would read my essays, he would tell me to delete certain words and I realized how many unnecessary words I used. For example, if I wrote the sentence, "I really hate English class and wish that I didn't have to write this reflection," I could edit it down to, "I loathe English class and wish I didn't have to write this reflection." In this example, I deleted the word "that" and changed "really hate" to "loathe." I've realized the word "that" is often unnecessary and can be deleted. Also, using the best adjectives is important in concise writing. Focusing on these things have made me a better writer in some ways, but I feel like they have also slowed me down. I am a perfectionist to begin with, so focusing on finding the perfect word for the context only exacerbates this. Going forward, I need to work on writing first without thinking too much about word choice and concision and then going back later and editing. My writing is best when I'm not paralyzed by perfectionism.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Henry Cleghorn ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Henry Cleghorn]{.s1} [Gillian Paku]{.s1} [INTD 106]{.s1} [February 10, 2019]{.s1} [Self Reflection]{.s2} [In my writing, I believe a strong thesis statement is important to the rest of the essay and it has become one of my strengths. Being able to illustrate what your essay is about will give the reader an insight into your thoughts to come. This skill was taught to me by my English teachers in high school and has been reinforced by my professors in college. If an essay doesn't have a strong thesis statement, the essay will seem disorganized and lack focus for there will be no structure. An example of using a thesis statement effectively could be "In this essay about the impact of concussions in sports, we will look at the percentage of kids having to quit sports due to head trauma and how concussions affect your brain in the future".This thesis statement displays what will be said in the coming paragraphs of the essay. ]{.s1}[]{.s1} [Personally, I believe I could work on tying my conclusion and thesis statement together to ensure my reader understands what I was have stated in the main paragraphs. Restating my thesis statement in my conclusion will help answer the questions my reader might have and can sum up the information I am passing on. I am very open to constructive criticism and and learning new skills to enhance my writing. I believe I can develop the skill of tying my conclusion with my thesis statement by reading essays and articles written by gifted writers. I believe it is important to address the skills and weaknesses of your own writing and to learn how to always improve. ]{.s1} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alexandra Clark ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I have been concentrating on my thesis statement as it addresses the issues in the question asked and provides a good direction for the rest of the essay. It should be clear and include all parts of the question that is asked. The thesis gives the reader their first impressions of the essay. A good thesis statement also gives the reader their need to know what is the basic point or idea that will be represented and how you will present it. A thesis is usually your introductory paragraph. If you do not answer the question asked it is not an appropriate thesis and if it is vague without taking a stance the reader becomes lost. I believe I can achieve an acceptable thesis that addresses the issues and themes specified in an essay. My AP World History teacher gave us a structure as well as an "Essay Writer's Handbook" that provides a good outline and questions to ask yourself when writing as essay. This has given me an outline to follow to be sure that I am not vague and use historical details to support my thesis. An example would be my original thesis "China's social class structure and India's caste system each affected their ancient civilizations societies," to being much more definitive saying "While India's caste system and Confucius social structure differed in how the social hierarchy was set up, both shared inequalities that characterized the social order." This sets me up to explain in detail how their social order was characterized with inequalities. In the near future, I would like the concentrate on improving my grammar. I want to be sure that the structure of my writings is using correct English and composition. Many times, I tend to rush my thoughts and my sentences do not make sense or the grammar is bad. I know I need to slow down with my writing, and I intend to read it to someone else to be sure it sounds correct. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: George Clapper ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [ ]{.Apple-converted-space}I have written a variety of papers, and projects throughout my time at college so far.

As I write these papers I try to focus on techniques I can use to make my paper as clear, and precise as possible.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} [ ]{.Apple-converted-space}One aspect of writing that I continuously focus on tends to be things like grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other writing educate that makes up an essay. For example for our first assignment in INTD 105, I had to write a formal introductory email to my professor explaining a variety of topics, ranging from favorite music, to what our major was. One way that my professor helped me revise my draft, was to make sure that I had punctuation such as semicolons and camas where I would be listing topics, and mentioning them respectively. Through her guidance, I was able to put fourth a stronger, and more professional essay. [ ]{.Apple-converted-space} [ ]{.Apple-converted-space}One aspect that I would like to greatly improve upon when I am here at Geneseo, is getting my points, and ideas across, without confusing the reader, and rambling. One example from my INTD 105 class, was when I had to construct my resume. I put down all of my notable accomplishments down according to subjects like education, or work experience. When I was writing this, I tended to repeat some of my accomplishments under more than one category. My professor helped me easily differentiate all of my accomplishments, and where they should go with respect to their category. This is important for Geneseo, seeing as it is a liberal arts college, and writing is essential for that. More importantly however, is writing in mathematics. When you think about math, you tend not to think about writing. However, proof in higher level mathematics such as analysis tends to be more rigorous than college English, or anything like that. It is essential to effectively get your point across, and communicate with others, since you will be sharing your ideas with people hailing from all parts of the world, who will need to understand your input on problems. Writing is essential for communication, not just for a math major, or an English major, but also to every other major here at Geneseo. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Steve Dallaris ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most the word choice or word preference throughout my essays or writing piece. That\'s how I make the essay more entertaining and more bearable for the readers or audience. Word choice helps me get my argument across easier and it helps me be more descriptive. My English high school teacher told me to download Webster Dictionary, the app on my phone to find different synonyms for words. For example, he told us, \"If you look up the word nice on the dictionary, you can find different meanings for the word like polite or sympathetic to help make the essay more sophisticated.\" The word choice helps me feel more comfortable about my writing and the sources to help me such as the dictionary makes me feel like a better writer. Going forward, I would like to focus on semi colons and punctuation. I feel like I have too many run on sentences in my writing and working on the punctuation would make me become a stronger writer. I feel that my sentences become too long and eventually becomes boring to the reader or the audience. I feel nervous about using a semi colon in my writing because I was never really taught how it was supposed to be used. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jake Clancy ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I focus mostly on details and explaining things thoroughly because I think that is the basis for a good piece of writing. If there isn\'t enough explaining its too vague and could leave the reader confused throughout the though story and you don\'t want them to lose interest you want to keep them hooked. I'm pretty content with the way I explain the details because my high school English teacher helped me correct my writing so I can become a better writer. She taught me a pattern/technique on how to add more detail without adding useless words into the paper. An example of the technique would be: "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[I went to the car dealership and bought a red supercar." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[This is not a good sentence because you could add so much more detail.

One of the most important aspects of good writing is the ability to ferry a reader through the text. Sentences that are constructed poorly will make the reader stumble over the words, and sudden transitions between two disparate ideas can be jarring and distracting. It is best to minimize these distractions --- the reader's focus should be on the ideas expressed in the writing, not the language and structure used to express those ideas. Unfortunately, this is difficult to achieve when discussing complex concepts. The writing tends to become loaded with stilted language and jargon. In writing, complexity and flow are at odds with each other, and it requires a skillful writer to guide the two into harmony. My awareness of literary flow has been shaped by reading philosophical books. Philosophers are constantly trying to use our limited language to discuss incredibly complex and abstract concepts. The ways in which they tackle this challenge can be great examples of how to balance complexity and flow. My awareness of this balance helps me find it in my own writing. For example, I initially wrote the second sentence of this paragraph as "Philosophers constantly try to express complex ideas in a simple way to carry their message across, and they have to balance complexity and flow to do this." The ideas in this sentence are spread out across it; the lines between different points are blurred. After revising the structure of the sentence and clarifying the language, the sentence reads "Philosophers are constantly trying to use our limited language to discuss incredibly complex and abstract concepts." The ideas from the the original draft are plucked out and given room to be expressed fully. Thus, the sentence is much easier to understand. In the future, I would like to focus more on the structure of essays as a whole, rather than individual sentence groups or paragraphs. I often find difficulty when creating outlines and when writing conclusions that tie in the rest of the essay. I feel that developing this technique will help make my writing more compelling and complete. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lacy Ciccarelli ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I write something one of the things I focus on is the flow of the piece. The flow of the story is very important because it keeps the reader engaged. Small spelling mistakes and words/phrases that are not where they should be can trip up a reader and confuse them. In my middle/high school I received lots of support when refining my work. What we were taught was to read it out loud and see how it sounded. After that the teacher would then take a look at it with us and help edit it more. Reading aloud helps me with the flow because I get a sense of how it sounds. Knowing how it sounds is important because you want it to make sense. In the first draft of an essay I did titled Best Buddies (based on the organization), I wrote "The Best Buddies walk is for raising awareness and funds to support individuals with IDD's. The donations for the walk go to the Best Buddies to help support their program." Though in my second draft I added in "The specialness of it is that a lot of people are coming together for a common cause" to help reinforce the idea that there is something special about it. When trying to make a case in something like an argumentative essay you often find many parts of someone's argument you want to use but have trouble paraphrasing enough. Since this sometimes describes me, from this point on I want to work on developing my paraphrasing skills. Even though I'm ok at it I often struggle with paraphrasing it to where I'm not plagiarizing. When writing essays, I will go to the college writing center for help and in turn develop my skills. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Abigail Chenette ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [So far in my academic career here at Suny Geneseo, I\'ve only written one essay. This essay had been written for my INTD class and made me realize my writing skills were a bit rusty. One aspect I tend to be most comfortable with in my writing is my introductions and conclusions. When writing my essays I like to think ahead about what the body paragraphs will include and think of clever ways to draw a reader into the rest of the essay. The other day I was helping a friend write an essay for an art history class. My friend had finished the essay but wanted some help to create a stronger introduction. I helped create the following introduction; "In 18th century BCE, a Babylonian king created a set of laws that was literally written in stone. King Hammurabi's set of nearly 300 laws were carved into a tall black basalt stele". I thought the first line I included was both witty and informative. I always try to include puns or clever sentences because I know if I were the one reading the first few lines of an essay if I weren\'t interested in what was stated I wouldn\'t continue reading the essay. I remember my 10th grade English teacher solidified this writing style in me because she would always state "Make sure you captivate your reader in the introduction or they won\'t bother reading the rest of your work." One area I would like to work on in my writing is the length I write. One would think that the more information present in an essay is better but my problem lies in essays that have a page limit. I find when I am given an assignment that can only be for example five pages long, I tend to write over the requirement. I then am forced to go back and "chop" my essay back down to the requirement. One way I can improve on this is to create thorough outlines of my essays beforehand so I don\'t write things that do not help the overall goal of the essay. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Phoebe Chen ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When I revise my drafts, I like to focus on carrying a consistent tone and writing style throughout my work. I find it extremely important to do so as it helps to set up writing that will meet with good academic standards. When one writes consistently, the diction, literary techniques and sentence structure are all the same. The writing is easier to understand and take in when writing is kept consistent. "The books were everywhere." In this sentence, it is very simple and short. "The books were scattered miscellaneously in all directions." This sentence is a more refined way of writing and it is important to keep this style consistent. If one were to write in a style of both the first sentence and second sentence, the writing would not be consistent and it would be confusing, along with that, it would deem the writer to be less credible and if his work was inconsistent. I have had instances where I have written papers that started off with strong grammar, sentence structure, and stated ideals of good academic writing, then did not keep consistent with my writing and ended the papers in a rushed manner with several writing errors. I have had a high school teacher state that before and since then, I have been trying to stay with a more consistent writing style. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One aspect of academic writing that I would like to improve includes the progression of ideas.

I believe that I got stronger at doing this when I entered Junior year in highschool and my theory of knowledge teacher who then became my English teacher in my senior year helped me develop my ideas. I remember writing my first essay for her and it didn't quite feel like I had my ideas in place the way I wanted to. I decided to stay after school more often to get her opinion on how I could better my writing skills in order to make my point clear and to have my ideas connect clearly enough for any reader to understand. I learned from her to lay out my main ideas and then find their correlations and connections. This way my ideas went from "The father was angry because Anna was not telling him the truth," to, "Anna's father felt disconnected from his daughter because their bond was slowly deteriorating, he was hesitant to believe she had been honest with him." I know that my writing is not perfect, but I work hard to make it better every time. From now on, I would like to work on being more detailed and descriptive.

My 11^th^ grade English teacher, Ms. Reitano, told me a way to expand my analysis and how to make it more detailed. The last paper I had done in the summer was about teachers and in the draft paper I said, "Moonlighting should be a choice for teachers as it is for other, not the economic reality." (Bell & Roach, 1990) and left it as it is. When I finish the final paper, I did more analysis of that and now its **" **"Moonlighting should be a choice for teachers as it is for other, not the economic reality."

I would like to keep focusing on the analysis. I had a hard time with giving details on many topics, so for me to be able to give specific details would help me and the person who read my papers.

Sitting down and having to convince someone that what I believe I have read or heard is true through the means of the written words is not for me. So when I write a paper, instead of beating around the bush and using creative metaphors I like to focus on the point I am trying to put across. It's not an easy task since the risk of going around in circles and making the same point repeatedly is high. But I believe that if I'm able to construct a decent introductory paragraph that would inform the reader of exactly what the paper is talking about, half the battle's won. A friend of mine once advised me to jot down whatever comes to my mind and not worry about editing until later. Taking her up on that advice, I realize I save a lot more time and get a chance to go through my paper multiple times while I edit the word vomit and make it comprehensible. While writing and editing I focus a lot on paraphrasing and checking for grammatical mistakes. I like to use articles for citations in my paper. For example, last year I wrote an essay for my geography class talking about the rape culture and treatment of victims in my country.

It was when I wrote a 1300 word essay that I realized that my organizational skills were not up to par. For this essay, I had to write about the different skills that I learned throughout the course of Humanities, and how these skills helped hone my sense in making connections between text and reality. Although I chose my two subtopics: analyzing characters who have learned what it meant to be human throughout their journey in the text and the values of religion, I still diverged from these two subtopics to reach the word count. My body paragraphs did not line up with my thesis, and they were disorganized in a way that each paragraph seemed like their own essay. Examples and information from one paragraph might have worked better as textual evidence in another paragraph with a different subtopic. Luckily, I was able to submit another final draft with corrections. This time around, I split up my two big body paragraphs into several smaller ones, and related each smaller paragraph to one another while still connecting each topic back to my main thesis. The tutors in the writing learning center helped me organize my paragraphs so that the purpose of my essay seemed more comprehensible. Now, I am fairly confident in my ability to properly connect and organize my paragraphs to create a proper reflective essay. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [My future plans in improving my writing include blending quotes into my essay properly. Whenever I choose long quotes for my essay, I usually use the whole quote as a separate sentence instead of properly blending it within my ideas in the paragraph. I want to be able to identify the important segments within the quote to use those parts specifically within my essay instead of increasing the wordiness of it. I hope to improve my flaws through INTD this semester. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Parker Cavotti ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Parker Cavotti I focus on making strong conclusions, to be more exact, strong final sentences. In an essay, the conclusion is used to quickly cover the main points of the essay and leave the reader with the writer's intention. Without a strong conclusion, readers are left wondering what the essay was even about and may have to re-read just to understand the gist of the essay. While I was studying for the SAT's in my junior year of high school, I began seeing a tutor who was working with me on my writing. One of her main focuses was on my conclusions, especially that I worked hard on moving away from summarization and moving more toward forming a final idea and thought. An example would be "It is evident that Plato believes in a more learner-centered model of teaching because, the men must work to get out the cave even when it hurts them, they are in control of their own future." In this conclusion instead of listing many reasons, going with one main point leaves the reader with one central idea that Plato believed in a learner centered model. Going forward I would like to continue improving on the mechanics of my writing such as punctuation and main sentences. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Valerie Catalano ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [While revising drafts of my essays, one thing try to do is read it aloud; or at least mumble the words if I can't exactly speak. This way I can hear the sentences written and determine whether or not they actually make sense when heard. Reading the essay aloud can also help me with precision and avoiding run-on sentences. For example, in an essay written for my anthropology course last semester I wrote, "Downs first went into his work in the area with an open mind]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[;]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ for as an anthropologist]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[,]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ one cannot be judgemental of the different ways of life being analyzed]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[... ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Downs's writing of the events he had witnessed while observing the Navajo people was extremely helpful in reading the text as he gave a neutral]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[,]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ third-person explanation..." As I had mentioned previously, reciting the essay out loud can aid to avoid repetition.

I write very much like how I speak, and I often find myself figuring out what I really want to say roughly halfway into my writing. This has helped me a great deal in developing a fairly distinct voice in my writing, but I've also learned that this approach often means that when it comes time for revision, most of my time is spent focusing on making my arguments less tangential and more structured, so that the points I'm making in my writing make almost as much sense on the page as they do in my head. One example would be from my final reflection for English 203 last semester. The task was to answer the simple questions of "what did you get out of this class?". The answer I was trying express was that this class taught me two important things. It taught me was what "meta" really meant, (as we spent much of the class talking about "meta" commentary, analysis and questions.), and it taught me that in order to understand any given piece of literature, you need to stop examining it under a microscope and look at what it's trying to say and how it connects to other works.

I\'ve come to learn that \"meta\" just means \"self-reflective\"\... ]{style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"} ["it clicked for me what the real significance of this course was. English 203 has been one long but important lesson, on how we as students and as literary scholars need to not just analyze literature from up close, by dissecting the plots and characters and themes of works, but also from afar. We need to be able to take a step back from the specifics and details of the works we study and learn to look at the most important parts in relation to the world and works around it."]{style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"} \ [These two excerpts were originally in the same paragraph, as my mind raced with ideas and I wrote as tangentially as possible, jumping from one idea to another in the blink of an eye.

At times, it is preferable to use phrasing with as few words as possible. Generally, this applies to science writing, when it is necessary to express significant amounts of information in a way that is comprehensible, but still able to accurately represent the data. In many other cases, however, it is more suitable not to shy away from a higher word count, and instead to make sure that the point I am trying to make, or the concept I am trying to explain, is as clear as I can manage to make it. For instance, providing evidence for the statement that ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*["In the last several years, inflation in Venezuela has reached nightmarish proportions,"]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ including that ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*["From 2015 to 2016, for example, the cost of basic household goods rose by a whopping 524%"]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ could be sufficient.

I have noticed that my writing tends to have paragraphs that go on for longer than they need to, and include thoughts that could be broken up and still make sense as separate paragraphs. This would mean I would need to pay more attention to how I organize my thoughts and how to write in full about one point before introducing another.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Margaux Carmel ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus a lot of energy on staying objective in academic writing, because unless an assignment is specifically asking for your opinion, it is unprofessional to inject your own opinions about the subject into the writing. For example, if a professor gave me an assignment to describe the complexities of abortion rights in the United States, I would not give my own opinions as to whether I think abortion is handled correctly in the courts. Instead, I would focus on more factual statements, such as the *Roe vs. Wade* Supreme Court case, the protests held outside of Planned Parenthood locations, and the March for Life movement, all of which reflect the complexities of abortion rights in the United States. Moving forward, I want to focus on being more concise in my essays. I have gotten comments from high school teachers and college professors that I tend to be very "wordy" in my academic writings, and that by being more concise, I would be able to emphasize the key points of the essay. I feel that this is extremely important for me to learn, as I am expecting to be writing a lot of essays in my academic career, being that my major is International Relations. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julia Cappiello ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Julia Cappiello]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/7/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [During my senior year of high school I was able to develop my writing skills in various ways. My English teacher emphasized the importance of revising essays specifically looking for irrelevant words and phrases. An example of this is the word "very" which is commonly overused. By adding this word before adjectives in the wrong context, the writer may sound less refined. I now have confidence specifically in my ability to be precise in my writing. Precision is important when writing because it allows the reader to follow the ideas presented. By avoiding unnecessary words and phrases a sentence can sound more sophisticated. An example of using precision to improve my writing is the transition from, "Research that has been performed in non-Western countries has worked to open up a discussion of relevant topics of sexology worldwide." to "Research performed in non-Western countries has generated discussion of relevant topics of sexology worldwide.". By eliminating the phrase "that has been", the meaning of the sentence is preserved and I am more direct. A writing skill that I am looking to improve this semester is the overall structure of my writing. It is important that my ideas connect and flow so that the reader can understand not only individual topics but also the underlying themes throughout. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: James Campagna ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I feel that when revising I have a tendency to focus on making my wording a little more sophisticated. Teachers in my high school would often critique me on how I word sentences, claiming it would be bland and I would sound more educated if I used synonyms for some of my words. Teachers would also ask that I expand my vocabulary and attempt to write with higher level words to help practice. A perfect example of this from my INTD 105 class is \"I think the 5 cent return on water bottles is great and works fantastic, companies should reward it and make recycling easy for customers.\" I\'d reread that and see words such as \"great\", \"reward\", \"easy\", \"customers\" and change that to a sentence like \"I think the 5 cent return on water bottles is exceptional and works fantastic, companies should incentivize it and make recycling simpler for consumers.\".

I attempt to prevent myself from using colloquial terms such as "some things" or "stuff". These words include ones that people would usually say to a friend or use over a text message. Instant messaging is destroying the English language many students or short cutting words and using terms in the wrong context. An example of this would be "It is brick out" or "ur" instead of saying you are and the teen is trying to say it is cold out. Text lingo has mislead writers and students to misusing the English language. In one of my essays, I also wrote "u " by accident because it was a habitat I had from text messaging my friends. English teachers would always write that my style of writing was vague. In my senior year of high school I was determined to improve my writing. I would go to one on one sessions after school to fix this issue. An example of poor usage of writing, was an essay I had to write on Hamlet and his struggle to cope with self doubt. In the essay, I would use expressions when I did not know the exact details. I once said in the essay "Hamlet had to face many things throughout his reign as a prince". Without details the reader has no context of the plot and the importance of the details. It is essential for the writer to know who their audience is when writing a paper. Composing an email to a friend would have a different tone compared to an email written to your employer. Having formality in your writing helps the reader receive a clear understanding of what your topic is.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Here at Geneseo, I want to learn how to be concise but specific in my writing.

The way I keep my academic writing organized is by following the template of my high school English teachers. In high school, we spent a lot of time learning how to write a well-developed research paper. The most important part was figuring out how to write a strong thesis in our introduction. I believe this is important because it sets the reader up for what you will be discussing throughout the essay. The thesis statement should have specific evidence for the argument. An example of this would be, "The media chooses to limit how they portray these individuals into three categories: the savant, the "quirky" or different, and the highly functioning individual. As a result, the media is socializing the people watching these shows and reinforcing and challenging stereotypes of autistic individuals." This thesis statement helps keep my essay organized because the three points of my argument will be the topics for the next three paragraphs. In the future, I would like to concentrate more on explaining the evidence and sources I find to support my argument. I need to focus on making my arguments clearer and explaining why my evidence supports the thesis. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Derek Callen ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} INTD 106 Derek Callen As I am revising my drafts, I feel that I the thing that gets the most feedback is related to my thesis statement. Whether it's the thesis statement in the introduction paragraph or relating textual evidence back to my thesis statement. I often find myself talking about things that don't relate back to thesis statement. The thesis statement is the most important part of the writing, and if you can't draw the reader into the essay, you've lost their interest in your work. A thing that my high school teachers would tell me was to do was to try and engage the reader whether it was through a short anecdote or a question. An example would be in my essay about the African American Experience in the modern age. My original thesis statement was "African Americans during the modern ages were treated like garbage." Although this was true, I clearly could've chosen a better word or phrase than just garbage. After a peer review, I came to the revision of "The African American Experience during the modern age in America was a true devastation to all those who were affected by this terrible time in our nation's history." As you can see, this thesis statement is more engaging, more formal, and not as broad as the previous thesis statement from my draft. Also, when linking textual evidence back to the thesis, I found that it flowed nicer with this slight revision to the thesis. In my future here at SUNY Geneseo, I'd like to work on portraying voice through my writing. I've always heard how this is how a good writer can stand out from the pack, and that would be useful whether its in the classroom, or on a resume for a job. I feel as this skill is hard to master so I'm hoping to have an idea on how to accomplish that goal upon graduating from Geneseo. If I can learn how to do this trait, I feel that my writing will be taken to the next level, and that will only help me in the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: James Cafone ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [As an academic writer, I mainly focus on elaborate language that creates vivid imagery in the mind of my reader.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}As someone who wrote through most of high school and had to write many pieces for history classes, I became a very tedious writer, trying to drive my point home in consecutive sentences.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}Basically, I would make sure that my reader knows exactly the way I feel about the subject so that they could properly agree or disagree.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}I also try to incorporate quotes into my academic writing to reinforce the point I am making; I weave the quotes into my sentences and avoid opening sentences with quotes but sometimes fall into awkward transitions.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}The idea of using elaborate language leads to my biggest skill of all, which is the ability to show my personality in my essays without it becoming overbearing.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}I've had many professors tell me that including personality in writing can be essential to my essay's success.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}I took this advice and ran with it as many of my essays are full of passion and the language that I use helps to convey that.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}For example, I talked about baseball in an essay and first wrote something like: "baseball is special to me;" I would say: "baseball is far more than a game, it is a lifestyle for people to absorb and become enthralled by and for me, it was easy to fall in love with."[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}Obviously, I would say more than that, but by being absurdly descriptive with your language, you can show people how you really feel, making your writing feel like a piece of art more than just an assignment.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}By saying "fall in love with," my reader knows that I am infatuated with baseball.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}The goal is to make your reader feel the passion in your writing; getting in a headspace in which allows you to feel motivated about the subject can enhance your performance as a writer.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}I have also had many family members tell me this about my writing and that I have a great skill in that.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}I try to be very tactful and efficient with my words so that my reader knows who I am.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}In summary, I try to use immersive language that aligns the readers\' emotions with mine, using quotations with skillful transitions and showing my personality in writing so that the result does not feel forced.[ ]{style="margin: 0px;"}]{style="font-family: Calibri;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Morgan Vullo ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [In my writing, I consciously focus on the support and evidence I have that back up my main points.

I need my argument to be solid and with limited amounts of ambiguity that way the reader can understand the point I am trying to convey. In high school, my English teacher worked hard to teach students how to choose the right evidence and what makes good evidence good. For research papers especially, he taught me what evidence best fit and where to include it to maximize it's support. For example, he stressed the creation of annotated bibliographies and honestly, they were a big help when it came to actually writing the paper.

If the writer decides to use a poor choice of words, that sentence/ those sentences can have a different connotation and ultimately not deliver the same message that they wanted to convey. I remember in junior year of highschool, my AP English teacher gave us examples of vague sentences and we had to transform that sentence into a more complex version. By visualizing that change, helped me understand why word choice is so important. Thus, I took this mediocre sentence, \" I felt glad that my skin was clearing up and wanting to find out the potential of this medication\...\" and changed a few words to make a more cohesive sentence, \" I felt ecstatic that my skin was clearing up and eager to find out the potential of this medication\...\". What I\'d like to learn is how to analyze claims and evidence better. I can interpret what they mean but elaborating on those statements is what I struggle with. Without a good analysis, I feel as I\'m stating facts and not really showing that I understand what the assignment is or what topic I\'m writing about.

If my writing is too vague, I can't understand it and if I can't understand it then whoever I give my paper to will know even less than me. Sometimes I will end a paragraph with a vague sentence that is kind of like a cliff hanger, and I tend to do it often, so I try my best to go back and put a nice conclusion at the end of my paragraph. The last essay I have written in college was this semester but before then my last essay was my final paper for sociology. My teacher, Mrs. Saddlemire, made it a huge point to back up our points with quotes and facts. She was one of my favorites, so I always asked her for help whenever I needed anything. Our final paper was a research paper on whatever topic we wanted. Mine was on the differences between men's and women's sports. I based most of it on statistics, like what percentage of people watch sports and compared the gender numbers. Most of the time I had to change some of my idea because I couldn't find quality data to back up a statement. If I were to say something about the number of people who watch NBA versus WNBA, I would be able to find a number to show the differences in viewers. If I were to compare something like the number of men, there are playing sports is higher than girls it would've been hard to find a stat to prove that. Also, I know I need to get better at introductions and conclusions to tie together the rest of my writing. I think taking INTD 105 will show me what I need to work on, and I will end up wanting to work on everything so my writing all around becomes better. Most of my work is research of reading based so I will also need to get better at finding the best quotes or data to back up my ideas. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Skyler Virginia ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of my writing that I focus on is my voice. Whenever I write an essay, I always make sure that my voice stands out. Having a strong voice in my writing allows the reader to focus in on the main points that I make and keeps them interested in what they're reading. I try to stay away from making my writing dull or lackluster, I want the reader to be pulled in and I want them to *really* listen to what I'm trying to say. The way I make my voice stand out is usually through vocabulary, like previously when I used the word "lackluster". If it's appropriate I'll italicize a word or phrase, again like I did previously with the word "*really*" (I think you're catching on to what I'm doing). Finally adding parenthetical statements also allows to reader to get a sense of your voice. All these elements together help enhance my writing while making it more interesting. In high school and in Humanities II I have been told many times that my voice is very strong in my writing. While taking humanities II I was given the option to choose creative writing topics such as what would a conversation between John Locke and modern-day politicians sound like. I was always given comments saying that what I had written was very creative and enjoyable to read, and whenever any instructor commented on my writing they always mentioned that I had a strong voice. Something that I would like to improve on in my writing is my organization. If I turn in a first draft of a paper it normally comes out jumbled and scatter brained, which may confuse the reader. Sometimes I'll be writing and just have absolutely no idea where its going, or I just won't know where to start. I'm hoping to eliminate this problem and become better at planning and organization to strengthen my writing skills. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Holly Vion ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Holly Vion]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [5 February 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When writing an essay, I mainly focus on utilizing voice throughout my paper. Voice can turn any essay or argument into an active paper that fully engages the reader. It was the harsh critique of my mother that taught me the significance of relaying my passion of a topic onto the reader. She made me think of my writing as more of an interaction between the reader and I, rather than an assignment. I reworked phrases such as " one major setback for African Americans was white supremacy" to "the pain and torture African Americans suffered due to white supremacy was inhumane." The difference in wording clearly showcases more emotion in the second example. This example emphasizes how voice is essential for strengthening an argument, as well as setting the tone of the paper. Voice also tells the reader a lot about the writer's intention for writing the paper. Despite the importance of voice, I would also like to include a variety of powerful and descriptive words in my future papers.

Out of everything I've learned, however, I focus the most on how I organize my thoughts. If my ideas are all over the place, my pieces of writing would be very difficult to follow and understand, which leaves it very confusing and boring for both myself and the reader. One aspect which has proven to be successful for me is something which both my high school English and Spanish teachers have taught me. Before starting any piece of writing, I create a quick template of all of the key ideas and thoughts I'd like to write about, in the order which makes the most sense. This is something which my Spanish teacher suggested I should do in my senior year of high school. If I'm creating an essay about an argument, in my introductions, I create a vague thesis, followed by my first body paragraph, which often is about the opposite argument about mine, and I then state my side of the argument in the next couple of paragraphs. As I begin to write my essays, I follow the template I made, as a reference, which not only makes the argument easier to understand, but it also makes it quicker to write. My high school English teacher taught me to highlight each sentence structure in a different color highlighter. I do this often as well because it helps me organize my writing in a way which is more entertaining, and less repetitive sounding. I try the best I can to make sure there are equal parts of simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences. This additionally helps with the flow of the writing. Although I do have the method of highlighting each sentence which helps with the flow and complexity of my writing, I would love to work on making my work flow even more. This is something I'd like to work on even more for writing at Geneseo and beyond. I want to make more writing which thoroughly entertains the readers by the way the writing sounds. Improving the flow of my writing is something which, in my opinion, would make my work be much better.

Thus, when writing, I focus mainly on limiting my wordiness while simultaneously expanding my vocabulary, and using varied sentence lengths and structures. I also aim to limit my use of "to be verbs" which merely result in writing that has diminished credibility. By doing so, I hope to make my ideas more coherent to the person reading my writing. It is also important to avoid overusing advanced vocabulary terms in writing, so as to prevent obscuring the main idea of one's argument. Implementing word choice that the reader may not understand, especially if there are many of these terms within a single sentence, may lessen the clarity of one's argument, thereby invoking confusion in the reader. An example taken from my paper on ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[***Frankenstein***]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}[, in which I implemented the previously mentioned strategies would be going from a long, wordy conglomeration of sentences like "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ Frankenstein is characterized as a man with an immense curiosity for the mysteries of life and death whom simultaneously maintains a very steadfast moral code. There is constant interplay between these two forces, resulting in the manifestation of an internal conflict within Victor; to indulge in his creation would be to surrender his beliefs and to relinquish his pursuit of knowledge would be to forsake the hard work he set out to accomplish over the past several months," to a much more concise group of sentences such as "Shelley characterizes Frankenstein as a man with an immense curiosity for the mysteries of life and death whom simultaneously maintains a very steadfast moral code. The constant interplay between these two forces manifests in an internal conflict within Victor; he cannot indulge in his creation without surrendering his beliefs, nor can he abandon the pursuit of knowledge without squandering the hard work he set out to accomplish over the past several months."]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ In high school, I was always a very strong writer. I did not hesitate in taking the initiative to improve my writing ability. Through constant editing and heeding feedback from my English teachers, I always obtained the results I desired. Going forward, I would like to improve my ability to embed quotes within my writing and to continue building upon the skills mentioned above. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: John Vecchio ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my academic writing, I focus the most on ensuring that my sentence structure is correct and I make sure that I do not write in run-ons or sentence fragments. I check this mistake more so than others that I may make because for myself as a writer, I tend to write very fast. As I am writing, I tend to try and get my ideas into writing as quickly as I can and often do not worry so much about how the sentence structure looks, as long as I am getting my point across. This skill is important because even though I may have a strong essay that makes valid claims when somebody else reads it, it will not sound right and my sentences will not be as cohesive as they should be. This is the main problem because it will take away from my credibility and will urge the reader, or grader of my writing, to focus more on the sentence mistakes that I've made and focus less on the point I am trying to get across. My high school English teacher has made me aware of this problem at the end of the year when I was writing my college essay. He taught me ways that I can fix this by implementing many different things into my writing, such as semicolons, commas, periods, or colons. This has greatly helped me going forward. An example of this is taking a sentence that is much too long or does not make sense grammatically, and turning it into an educational thought which flows correctly. Such as, "I am a senior at High School East. I enjoy taking business classes. I want to become an accounting major, should I get accepted." I would correct this to, "I am currently a senior attending High School East, who enjoys taking business classes. If I get accepted, I aspire to become an accounting major." I understood that the sentences did not make sense being as fragmented as they were and I worked to combine them correctly. Moving forward, I would like to concentrate on the vocabulary that I use in my academic writing. I feel as though I do not use enough words that are at the collegiate level. I aspire to make my writing more formal and intelligent. When I submit any papers to professors, I want them to feel as though an intelligent college student wrote them and get a sense that this person knew exactly what they were talking about. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jordany Vasquez ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jordany Vasquez]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I focus mainly on using figurative language on different types of essay, because of how I establish the importance of my essays. I use a chart back in high school that a high school teacher gave me, where I wrote all the figurative language on one side, the definition right next to it, and write how to use it on an essay in the other side. This template or form helps me in finding out how the reading of a passage is being used, what figurative language is being used in the reading, which I think is helpful. For example, in one of the passage, it says that a father took his two kids and went to his cellar because the forecast shows there was a tornado approaching by, so in a couple hours past by and they came out of the cellar and the father said " don't worry guys everything is going to be ok" basically this is really ironic because clearly its not ok cause of the tornado and the destruction it caused.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [What I most need help in is trying to write a thesis and conclusion on an essay.

When used sparingly and selectively, quotes can bring a very powerful tone to an essay, and can force a reader to see a perspective they may not have considered before. I used to struggle with this because I would love the writing from my sources so much that I\'d put in a *lot* of long quotes, some that would be whole paragraphs. My editor at the local (tiny) newspaper I write for taught me to use fewer long quotes and more partial quotes\-- direct quotes that fit into a sentence of my own words. I started using these all over the place. He then taught me to only use quotes if the words of the quoted source were definitely much more powerful than ones I could come up with on my own. He said if they were not, I should just paraphrase or summarize (and still cite of course). In an article I wrote about a teacher who is now a parent, I had included a partial quote that was not necessary. The sentence read as follows: \"She admitted that when she was a teacher, she \'never could understand the disconnect,\' when students didn't do their homework that was clearly assigned and laid out for them.\" This quote did not necessarily further the impact of the sentence because it was in quotes. When I revised, I instead used a partial quote that was one word and had a lot of meaning and perspective behind it. I wrote that \"She admitted that when she was a teacher, she had been \'appalled\' by the students\' \'horrendous\' ability to keep up with assigned work. These quotes were more concise while also getting a more important feeling across. There are countless aspects of my academic writing I hope to improve while studying at Geneseo, but one of the most important ones to me is perfecting the thesis-writing process. I have alwasy struggled a bit with being able to write descriptive and specific theses, while still keeping them clear and concise. I\'d like to work on that a little\-- making my introductions to essays a little more smooth. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jillian Valvo =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jill Valvo]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I focus on forming a specific thesis and then continuously referring back to it, throughout my entire paper. In my early years of high school, I tended to struggle with this. I would create a thesis but then ramble about many different things in my body paragraphs. My 11th grade English teacher taught me to really focus only on one thing at a time, and to help do so, restate my thesis at the beginning of a new paragraph. This helped me so much because it reminded me to stay on topic while writing my papers. Since then, I have been very successful at doing this in my papers. I feel as though I will be able to continue to \-\-- this skill in my writing from now on. An example of this is in a paper a wrote about Sexual Education in schools. The thesis of my paper was "although it is an uncomfortable subject for some adults and children, it is very necessary to teach sexual education classes in schools in America for many reasons." I used this thesis statement throughout my paper. In the second paragraph I stated, "One reason Sexual Education is a necessity in schools is because many children may not get this information elsewhere." I then when on to my second point by saying, "Another reason that Sexual Education is important to teach in schools is to prevent teenage pregnancies and the transfer of sexually transmitted infections." These sentences at the beginning of my paragraphs helped me focus on one specific point and not ramble on, potentially confusing the reader.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While continuing my education, I would like to concentrate on using more details in my writing. I tend to get right to the point when writing, without really describing well.

I believe that being enrolled in a freshman writing seminar this semester will give me the opportunity to practice using more details and further describing what I write about. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jared Valvo ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of my writing that I already focus on is writing clear and direct while making a point. I think this is the most important skill I have because it lets the reader know exactly what point i'm trying to make. If the reader of my essay is unaware of my stance it could lead them to disagree with my points or be confused throughout the whole essay. This aspect was generated by my high school English teacher. He stressed to all of his students the importance of making a clear and direct claim, especially in the thesis statement. An example of this would be if I first started with a statement like "In some ways the main character was mean and not a good friend" or if I said "Small business owners do a decent amount of work to keep their company running". In my revision process I would be more clear and say "The main character had no moral fiber" or "A small business owner dedicated their hard work to sustain a profitable business". In the future I definitely need to develop my vocabulary and grammar in the future.

In doing so, I like to point out what type of literary device it is so that the reader can start to develop a sense of who the writer actually is and the importance of the device. After making this a priority for me in my writing, some of my peers have provided feedback that I don't need to overanalyze at times meaning two sentences should be a max amount and anything after is just a waste of both the writer and readers time if it is rambling. In one of my essays, an example using literary analysis is ""she says she saw herself as a "dark rock surged upon, over swept by a creamy sea" (Hurston,114). Hurston's use of diction here to call a group of white people a "creamy sea" emphasizes her point that she is being singled out and is not used to it. She saw it as a "sea change" (Hurston, 115) considering she was never viewed as the minority due to being from a colored only town"". In this, I point out how the author uses diction and how effective it is to develop a main idea.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Looking into the future of my time at Geneseo, I really want to focus on constantly referring back to my thesis statement and linking my thoughts to it as well.

That is always my number one priority when I write. When I was younger I used to always have problems with grammar. For example, I used to not know how to use the right type of there, they're, or their but now I know exactly when to use each one. I take great pride in having great punctuation and grammar in my academic writing because I feel that if you don't have proper grammar and punctuation your writing won't be read with respect. Reading other peoples writing whether it's emails, text messages, essays or even communication in person and seeing the incorrect usage of there, their, and they're irritates me and motivates me to use the correct version. In one of my writing pieces in eleventh grade I got twenty-five points taken off of my paper for incorrect usage of there and their. An example of the incorrect usage of there and their was when I wrote "it was there house" instead of writing "it was their house" not knowing that there is used for possession. One aspect of my academic writing that I want to develop at Geneseo and beyond is improving my writing structure and organizing my ideas. I feel that sometimes I struggle when I try to organize my thoughts and ideas and end up writing them wrong structurally. It is very important to have great writing structure because if you don't there will be thoughts and ideas all over the place and your writing will not be organized and easy to read for the reader.

This is important to give the paper a direction and give the reader a clear view on what the paper will consist of. If a concise and direct thesis is not given, the reader will lose information necessary to the understanding of the entire argument at hand. Many times, in high school we were required to do structured outlines before writing our final draft. These outlines helped me write a strong thesis because it has exactly the format that I should be using for my argumentative essays. For instance, instead of making the thesis for an argument "Gene therapy should be allowed because of the potential benefits it could provide to patients", a better, more developed thesis would be, "The FDA should decrease their rigid regulations on gene therapy research in the United States because of the potential that gene therapy has to cure previously incurable illnesses. In addition, biotechnological advancements are increasing the safety of gene therapy for patients." The more specific thesis gives the reader an idea of exactly what will be touched upon in the essay. After stating my thesis, I can begin to develop each argument in the following body paragraphs. Now and into the future, I would like to work on being more concise in my writing by only mentioning what is necessary to my argument. Many times, I find myself being too wordy in my papers and writing more than what is necessary in order to fill a page or word count requirement. I fear that this can quickly make the reader disengaged and bored while reading my work. Perhaps in my writing moving forward I can read back to myself each sentence and see if it is critical to my paper or if I could do without it. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Aiden Budinski ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Currently, in my academic writing, I focus on diction choices when I am editing. I want to use the best word that I can to succinctly and effectively convey my argument. For example, in my resume, I carefully used certain words to make my resume stand out. Instead of "helping," I wrote "assisting" and instead of saying I know how to do something, I used the word "proficient." When I edit, I look in a thesaurus to determine if there is a better word that I can use in my writing to make my writing look and sound better. This skill is important because it is essential to the clarity and sophistication of a paper. I have grown in this skill throughout high school and college due to peer reviews and comments from my teachers when formulating a paper. A skill that I need to improve on is formatting, especially within news writing. As I have started writing for the school newspaper, I need to learn how to format my paragraphs so that they are coherent with each other and that all ideas are conveyed in one paragraph.

In the past, I have been told by teachers and instructors that I should more thoroughly explain what my quotation is showing. I make a point to work on this while writing, and even go back and add information to further explain what I am trying to say, because the analysis of a quote provides context to relate back to the thesis. For example, a quote from an essay that I wrote as a freshman in high school read, "She had no evening clothes, no jewels, no nothing. But those were the things she wanted; she felt that was the kind of life for her. She so much longed to please, be envied, be fascinating and sought after." My analysis of this quote was simply "Madame Loisel only wants these riches for herself." Instead of restating the quotation, I now focus on explaining how it relates directly back to the thesis. If I was writing the same analysis now, I would say "Madame Loisel's attitude towards having luxury items for herself proves her character to be selfish." This analysis explains how the character's actions shown by the quote relate to the thesis of the essay, rather than simply putting the quote into my own words like before.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An area that I can continue to develop in my writing is my conclusion, or the last paragraph of my essays.

This is a very important aspect of my writing because it is what ties the main idea or main arguments all together with the supporting details that I have written in my essay. Without this essential feature in my essay, my essay sounds unorganized and seems to not build a strong argument. It makes my essay jump from one detail to another and does not give it structure enough to piece all the ideas together. I have received many comments about this from various people in the past. They explain to me that my essay does not fit all together and that I must smoothly transition from one idea to another. One of my english teachers from high school has told me that my ideas and details are excellent but that I tend to mix them all up and end up with a less well-constructed essay. An example of this would be from one of my most recent essays: "She uses her voice for the good of the people and the spread of love and acceptance around the world. This talented young lady has shown the world how outspoken and educated she is in political, social, and many other topics to the public."

I can truly say that I have succeeded in developing my skills thus far. There are still certain aspects of my writing that I would like to improve. Taking this class is a perfect opportunity for me get professional feedback on what I still need to further develop. It's interesting, my biggest strength also intertwines into my greatest weakness. I'm always precise and make sure that I include multiple details to support my main ideas. Every requirement for papers is always fulfilled thoroughly. This reinforcement is important but sometimes it leads me to including too much information. When I have multiple ideas, I tend to become unorganized and scatter my thoughts randomly throughout my writing. My goal is to concise these ideas and separate them logically within paragraphs. I'm certain that if I can fix these bad habits my writing will progress even further throughout my college years. My English teachers were aware that I struggled with this issue and made specific accommodations. I was always provided organization worksheets that I would use before writing an essay. These sheets would include spots for an intro, 3 main ideas, 3 details for each main idea and a conclusion. As time went on, I started making these sheets on my own to organize my ideas. Everyone has something that specifically works for them when it comes to their writing styles and habits. I'm thankful that my high school teachers took the time to help me identify this issue and gave me a solution for it. During my time at Geneseo, I would really like to stop making these sheets and just be able to have my thoughts flow naturally. Of course, this doesn't just happen, it comes with practice. An example of a time that my thoughts were very scattered in my writing was my original rough draft for my college essay. I was very nervous writing it because of the impact it has on my acceptances. The topic I chose was my parents' divorce, I was so little and happened to be very close with both of my parents. When I was writing my essay, I was scattering events that happened at all different ages.

Grammar and punctuation is important because it is the first step in achieving clarity in a piece of writing. I think that an argument is weakened when the paper includes little to no understanding of grammar and punctuation. When I write a first draft, I immediately print it/turn it in without a second look for any kind of error. Meanwhile, when revising papers, I go through each paragraph checking for spelling and grammatical errors because of my disorganized revision process. I like revising papers as it gives me the chance to improve the strength of my argument as well as the clarity of my writing. For the future, I would love to work on developing clear, well-developed arguments as every paper I write gets points off for "lack of focus" or "underdeveloped arguments." For example, I tend to make vague assumptions such as "perspective is also extremely important when considering Jane's position..." that lack a clear objective and fail to add to my argument. I have learned to make better claims where "perspective is also extremely important when considering Jane's position..." becomes "Marsh uses Stephen and Jane's perspectives to display the disconnect between the duo," a small step towards clarity. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sophia Bran ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When it comes to my writing, whether it be essays, summaries, or even my creative writing, my main focus is always to get my point across to the reader.

Often times, people confuse the quantity of their essays with the quality of their writing. I used to think that the longer the essay the better it was, but thankfully I learned that to be untrue. If anything it actually lowers the reader's interest because nobody wants to read a long essay that drags. I learned this because the high school I attended would assign a research paper every year. When it was time to hand in our first drafts I would always receive the same feedback, which was to stop being repetitive. Unknowingly, I would constantly restate my sentences. This would make the reader lose interest in what I had to say about the topic because on top of it being such a long essay, it was saying the same things over again. My teachers suggested that I try peer editing with another classmate so I can hear a secondary opinion. Having my essay read from another person helps me see if I accomplished my goal of capturing the reader's attention, and whether or not my point was clear.

Expanding my range of vocabulary will allow me to find words that will help get my point across to the reader. An example would be instead of saying, "Social media is bad for people because it distracts them from school," I could say, "The use of social media hinders individuals from their education."

I do this to make sure that anyone who would read my work thinks of me as an intelligent person who works hard to make her work reflect herself. I also take great care in making sure that anything I write about makes sense and is always well thought out. Whenever I write a thesis for a paper, I always write a few different versions of it and make sure that the one I decide to use in my paper is correct and makes sense for the reader. For example, I had to write a history paper last semester on the book Divine Right's Trip, and I knew that my professor was a tough grader, so I spent a lot of time making sure that my thesis for this paper was well thought out and intelligent. The thesis started out as " This essay will argue that Gurney Norman's portrayal of the liberty of the Counterculture provides extreme cons for the main character, D.R., an through going home to Kentucky and learning more about the value of having roots and family, shows the reader why there needs to be a middle ground between the two sides to better the main character." but as I went through and thought about my thesis it turned into "This paper will argue that D.R.'s evolution in Gurney Norman's novel Divine Right's Trip symbolizes the maturation of the author himself in his realization that the counterculture needed to blend with traditional values using D.R.'s experiences and troubles throughout the novel." As I move forward in my education at Geneseo, I hope to focus more on making sure that my writing flows easily throughout the whole essay. I have noticed that I sometimes branch out onto tangents that create a lot of unneeded information in the story. I hope that I can learn to make better use of the information I have rather than trailing off with information that the reader doesn't need. I believe that getting more control over this aspect of my writing will help me not only in my college career but also in my professional career after I move on from college. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Dan Bosio ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One of my main focuses when I am revising a rough draft is my descriptiveness. When I write I have a tendency to generalize or group things together. If I do not focus on being descriptive, my writing is often boring and does not seem very knowledgeable. I have been noticing this a lot in my search got an internship and writing cover letters. When describing responsibilities of previous jobs, I can be too vague, which hurts my cover letter. An example of this was when I wrote about my role as Assistant Manager. Previously I wrote "I have worked at the Brighton Tux Shop for three years, and as Assistant Manager for one year." This doesn't tell any details about my role or what I did. I changed that to "As an Assistant Manager at the Brighton Tux Shop, my roles included new employee training, maintaining inventory, and customer satisfaction." Not only does that look better, it also gives potential employers some insight into what I did and makes my work history look more attractive. One aspect that I want to develop for the future is writing an outline before I begin to write a paper. I have been told from multiple sources that using an outline before I start helps tremendously with keeping thoughts in order and having a well-constructed paper. Currently I just open up Word and start to type. I find that I often do not where to go next and spend a lot of time staring blankly at my computer. Not only do I think that this could help my writing, but it could also help in other aspects of life where my preparation may be lacking. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Benjamin Bosak ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I use the skill of ordering events to make a clear and concise timeline. Making sure that events are placed in chronological order creates a sense of order and rhythm in a writing piece. When events are just thrown onto a page without rhyme or reason, the reader is left having to pick up the pieces of the author. The reader then has to establish their own timeline and try to reason out which events are laid out where. This is especially important when summarizing or analyzing other literary works. It is important to specifically tell the order, in order to preserve the original authors intentions. I was taught this skill in the classroom, but also through mentorship by a business colleague. This skill is critical in formal emails, as clients want and need to know the structure of what you are offering them. An example of this skill used in my writing would be the last time I wrote a business proposition for a client. I could have wrote \"We will do the reception, ceremony and park video shoots and create trailers for you. Also we will meet with you and discuss details.\" A more concrete and specific message would be \"First, we will meet and discuss the details of your wedding day to make sure we create the best possible product for you. We intend to create trailers from the work we will do at your ceremony, followed by your reception and park shoot.\" This creates a timeline that the reader can follow step by step and see the details, specifically outlined for each event. A skill I wish to further develop is the art of being persuasive in the argument my work is making. Being persuasive is an excellent skill to have, especially in the business world where it is your job to persuade clients to hire you for your services. I tend to find that my writing revolves around the same points and does not really draw the attention of the reader to one central point that I am trying to make. Learning skills is an important quality for any person that seeks to better themself in society. When I stop trying to learn, my relevancy diminishes, as I get stuck in old ways. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Elizabeth Bianchi =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Consciously I tend to focus on making each topic sentence a strong representation of the paragraph's main idea. The topic sentence should also connect back to the overall thesis in a brief and precise way. There should be a different topic sentence as the first sentence of every new body paragraph. I feel that I've learned to keep information relevant and use details to support the topic. I make sure not to add information in the paragraph that could go along with a different topic in a later paragraph. I used to oftenly get my topic sentence placement throughout my essays confused and I felt like the essay didn't flow. Another mistake I used to make is being too vague. For example, in an essay back in senior year of high school I wrote "Students should not go on their phone and look up answers when homework doesn't make sense" as one of my topic sentences on a rough draft. I had my student aid helper in class read over my essay. She told me some tips such as elaborating and listing a couple examples in order to help the reader better understand what the paragraph will be addressing. Instead of the previous loosely stated topic sentence, I changed it to "Rather than having the internet as first resort when stuck on homework, students should refer to the textbook, notes, or teacher for help". This topic sentence for my final copy is more thorough in giving examples of what will be talked about throughout the paragraph. This advice helped make my essay flow from paragraph to paragraph while remaining on topic, not being vague, and not repeating myself. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [An aspect of writing that I strive to improve is my use of vocabulary. A strong vocabulary can help to effectively convey points across. I feel as though I get lost in putting too sophisticated of a word that doesn't seem like my tone of writing or putting a word that isn't creative enough. I think that I need to find a balance in my vocabulary. I plan to find this balance with the combination of the internet, conversations with professors, and dictionaries. Throughout my time at Geneseo I am confident that the resources and people I can go to will help satisfy this goal. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jessica Benedetto =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One thing I feel as though I do well in my writing, and focus on consistently and consciously, is developing a well constructed argument. I try to break both the complexities and the subtle nuances of the topic into a coherent digestible argument that is revealed clearly to the reader. I try to give enough background in the writing, so that the reader can be caught up to speed. Often, I try to set my argument up as if it was a story, building up to the strongest pieces of evidence and ending with a strong conclusion. For my final exam essay last semester in my U.S. History course, my professor stressed this in the comment he left on my paper: "You did an excellent job of distilling the class into a digestible, well-supported argument. Well done." This accomplishment; however, is not something I let go to my head. I am always trying to be actively mindful of developing a coherent piece of writing and also at the same time, improving my writing skills. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [Coming into Geneseo, a majority of my teachers wanted me to begin using first person pronouns in my writing to include my own viewpoint. This is something I am still a little unsure about and not well versed in, since in high school my teachers stressed the opposite. Suddenly thrown into the scene of using the first person perspective in an essay, I feel like I have adapted well but there is definitely room for improvement. Sometimes I feel like I am giving too much of my opinion versus actual valid analysis of the subject, so I feel I could definitely use work on that. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sharon Becerra Pachon =================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Sharon Andrea Becerra Pachon]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [When I have to write formally, nowadays I usually start by writing my thesis. The next step I take is, I create a list of the supporting points that I am going to develop to prove my thesis, and in some cases some contradictory points that I would refuted. After having a good list of topics to develop in my paper, I usually write a short introduction and the conclusion. This allows me to make a visualization of my departure point and my finishing line. Finally, I write the body of the text, that will support my thesis. I think this system has been very useful for me, specially because when I want or need to cite, I know exactly where to look at. When I write the basic structure (I like to call it the spine of my essay), the authors that will help me support each point come to mind. In case I do not know any source that helps me, then it means that I am lacking information. This process gives me an idea of exactly what I need to research and what piece of information I am missing to prove my thesis. I started using this structure after I had to ask help to my sister in order to structure most of my essays. I used to write by just letting my knowledge of the topic flow on the paper. She taught me this method, which I use for almost every formal piece that I need to write. For example, in the last paper I wrote I had a good idea of my thesis, so I proceed to write my "spine"and conclusion:]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Thesis: ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*["]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The malleability of the Afrobeat has allowed this music to]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* *[ evolve in such a way that enables the preservation of important cultural ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* *[elements of black cultural identity in Cuba."]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* [Spine:]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} *[" - History]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* - *[Musical evolution and fusion]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* - [Political content within Cuban Music]{style="font-weight: 400;"} - [Music function in performance]{style="font-weight: 400;"} - [Music in Religion"]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Conclusion:]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Music is and has been the guardian and refugee for Afro ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}* *[Cubans.

I tend to quote too much instead of paraphrasing broader ideas. It is sometimes difficult for me to be concise with big concepts, therefore I would use directly the words of the author, making my writings excessively extensive.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Alicia Bauers =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my writing education thus far, I believe that my teachers have effectively helped me grow as a writer and polish my technique, but I do think that I have much more potential to grow even more. One aspect of my academic writing that I have spent much time focusing on is the structure of my writing. In the past, I would say that I had a basic understanding of how to structure my writing; most times consisting of an introduction paragraph, two body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Although, I often lacked a proper flow between paragraphs, and did not make much of a point to focus on the main backbone of the writing such as the claim, subclaims, strong ending conclusion, etc. At the time, I did not understand the importance of such subtle details in my work and I was so focused on ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[what ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[my argument was than ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[how]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ to effectively express my argument. For example, rather than having an abrupt switch in focus between body paragraphs that is somewhat hard to follow, I have learned to use transition words- such as additionally, furthermore, on the other hand, In opposition, moreover, etc- between my body paragraphs to promote an effortless flow between separate ideas. Likewise, I have learned through much practice that an effective piece of writing consists of clear subclaims that relate to the overall argument throughout the work, rather than separate ideas all tied together in the conclusion. I have realized the significance of a very thoughtful structure in my writing because without a proper flow and connection of ideas and claims in my work, the writing is at times hard to follow and not as effective. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Furthermore, I am very aware that although my work is better, it is not perfect. I still have much room for improvement here at Geneseo and I am sure that one prominent aspect of my writing I need to put more focus into is my ability to get to the point efficiently without going overboard explaining my point. I believe that a good argument/piece of writing does not have to be long but rather precise and thoughtful. I have always struggled with getting to the point without excess information/words that are not necessary in order to make my point. I think that it is very important for me to bolster this skill because in writing a lengthy piece of writing, it is very easy to lose focus of what I am saying and confuse the reader, which is not my desired effect of my writing. I hope to learn to be more precise in my work so that I can be meaningful rather than over explained. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Michael Barnett ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Michael Barnett]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [10 February 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [ One aspect of academic writing I like to focus on when composing an essay is knowing who my audience is. I believe this is a very important part of the writing process because it allows you to use specific wording based on how your reader will interpret your message. Having this ability makes it easier to spread ideas and will help anyone become a stronger writer. Although I now find this to be key, it wasn't until eleventh grade where I began to emphasize the importance of knowing the audience. My English teacher at the time, Mr. Eaton, helped me understand that the audience's expectations and prior knowledge regarding your topic will determine how they perceive your words. For example, after electing to write an essay on concussion rates in the NFL, a topic in which I know a lot about and am very interested in, he told me it was necessary to stay brief since I likely had a better understanding of the topic compared to my peers. Using this to my advantage helped me significantly because I was able to keep their interest for a long period of time while still being able to effectively get my message across. As a writer, I also am aware that there are several areas in which I need to improve on to become a more advanced writer. For example, organization and planning have always been one of my greatest weaknesses. Whenever I write essays, I usually find myself getting right into the introduction without a proper outline or general idea of where to take it. I believe this limits my ability to expand on ideas and puts me in danger of losing the attention of the audience. In the future, I would like to try sitting down and listing potential ideas that I can incorporate into my essay. Additionally, setting time aside to plan and gather information is something that could also help me greatly. There will always be ways in which I can continue to grow as a writer, but for right now, I focus on breaking old habits and maybe even picking up some new ones to be the best writer I can be.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Teresa Barbier ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I greatly focus on using a lot of imagery. In middle school and high school, I was always taught to \"paint the reader a picture\". Personally, I believe this is one of my writing strengths. Through the use of adjectives, I have the opportunity to inject more creativity into my writing. For example, if I was describing my dorm room I wouldn\'t just describe it as a basic college dorm room. I would describe it as a homey space where the unique interests of my roommate and I have intertwined. I would then go on to describe more about how my dorm looks, how it feels to live there, and even how it smells. I\'m the type of person that writes for hours once I\'m on a roll. Often times in doing so, I have a good amount of run-on sentences in my writing. This is what is corrected the most when I proofread my work. In an essay I wrote for my Interpersonal Communications class last semester, I had to correct many run-on sentences. Here\'s an example of one; \"[I am making this claim because I have the tendency to attempt compromisation relatively quickly during conflict, if the other person or people will not comply I become quite competitive\". To fix this run-on I could either make these two independent clauses separate sentences or use a semicolon instead of a comma between them. I hope to become more aware of when I\'m writing run-on sentences in the future. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Nichole Barberan ============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my writing career, which blossomed in my high school Honors and AP English courses, one thing I learned was to avoid "fluff" in my writing, and adequately fill the spaces with evidence that support the claim I am addressing. By always applying this rule, my writing began to read more clearly and to the point, while still being complex and having voice. I also began to be able to be able pick out evidence from various resources, such as literature, online databases and articles and using it to my advantage to support the various ideas the piece was expressing. The first place where this skill was really drilled into my writing process was in my sophomore Honors English class, where I was writing a paper on how innocence was lost in many different ways, based on a book called "Bless Me, Ultima" by ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Rudolfo Anaya. This paper had to be a certain page requirement and I had gathered so much evidence from within the text but too much "fluff" in my writing to really prove my point in a concrete way. My teacher then told me to take advantage of the evidence I had to support my claim, to remove the nonsense within the writing and fill it with textual evidence that would only strengthen my writing and make it more direct; I took her advice and have been using it ever since. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I applied this rule on my first writing assignment from INTD 105, when I was reflecting upon the sustainable practices in my everyday life; within the thesis I wrote "Somethings that I do that I consider sustainable are using reusable water bottles, using real utensils and limiting the amount of time I am in the shower...". Once I was writing the opening sentence of the first body paragraph, I did not reintroduce the whole idea of what my practices were, I just started talking about the use of reusable water bottles in my life, no fluff. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I personally think that using this technique in my writing has been very helpful because it strengthened my writing and allowed for my to have a structure to it; I go from a broad idea to one or two pieces of evidence to support it and avoiding the use of "fluff" that would only distract the reader from the point I am trying to make. I think that going forward in my writing career, I would like to be able to self revise in a more effective way and maybe learn to better meet word requirements. I believe one way to do this is to make an actual outline for my writing, which is usually only for major papers, but to begin to apply that skill for most writing assignments to be able to have an even more organized final product in the end. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Zachary Barber ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} An aspect that I focus on in my writing is my analysis of a text. Often when I am writing a paper I will find and insert quotes that support my thesis well. However, sometimes my analysis is lacking. When I go back to revise my papers, I see that there is much more analysis of the evidence that needs to be done. While I am working on the first revision of my papers, I often feel that the quotes are enough and don\'t feel the need to analyze them. But when I go back to revise them, I realize that more analysis is needed. I have heard this from most of my English teachers in high school. That my papers would take the next step forward if I just increased my analysis. For example, in a paper I am writing for INTD 105 I included this quote but just moved on to my next point without really evaluating the quote. "Those cement faces and eyes of hate that burned the clothes off you if they happen to see you lounging on main street downtown on Saturday" (351). Her grandmother blew out the coal-oil lamps and had a talk with Uncle Willie. I see this when I go back and revise my papers. For my writing now and in the future, I hope to improve the structure of my papers. Sometimes they can get disorganized and distract the reader, taking away from my thesis. So, I desire to work on this in my time here at Geneseo. By using things such as outlines to keep my thoughts clear and concise. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Erin Ball ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When writing, I focus primarily on using plenty of useful and reliable quotes and then relating them to the topic to help further prove the thesis of the essay. This skill was one I practiced heavily in my high school English classes and have found that providing the reader with many relevant quotes and even clarification about the quotes, helps to keep an essay interesting and easy to understand. An example of this would be using a quote such as \"What\'s in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet\", and then continuing by explaining that in this quote Juliet is declaring her love for Romeo despite his name and determining that she doesn't care about the families' mutual hatred. By using this quote and thoroughly explaining it, I would be able to support a thesis such as "Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet,* has a common theme of forsaking everything for love". In the future, I'd like to further develop my skills of inputting my own thoughts and feelings into an essay. I have understood the importance of being able to relate a quote or fact back to the author's personal thoughts since high school, however, in some instances I struggle to do this. Often in an essay I rely too heavily on a quote and the meaning behind it instead of trying to relate it back to my thoughts and experiences. Having the ability to insert personal opinions and experiences into an essay helps to make the topic more relatable and authentic to the reader. This is a skill that I often struggle with, especially when writing about a concept I am not overly aware of or comfortable with. I hope to become more comfortable with inserting my own thoughts and experiences in my writing in the future. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Christopher Baglieri ================================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Through the progression of my schooling, I have inherited many writing skills that have been built upon to get where my writing is today. One writing skill that I specifically focus on in my writing today is using transitions to make my thoughts flow coherently. This is an important skill because without transitioning from statement to statement coherently, the reader will more than likely have a tough time making sense of it. Furthermore, even if a reader is able to piece together the writing, it would be tough for them to take incoherent thoughts seriously. In order to make a piece of writing flow well, from the beginning to the end, I usually plan my writing before I actually writing it. By doing this I am able to place relevant information together in the same paragraph. To make two different paragraphs flow together, I usually include a sentence at the bottom of one paragraph, to set up the next. This sentence acknowledges what I just talked about, while also providing a transition to the next paragraph. A time when I did the effectively was in my final essay for my humanities class senior year of high school. In this essay, I discussed the social issues Macklemore talks about in his lyrics. Between talking about two different topics he sings about, I included the sentence "While this is one social issue Macklemore has personally been touched by and has also witnessed, there are many more meaningful songs in the album." By including this sentence, the reader knows I am going to talk about a different song and social issue, and the two different sets of song lyrics will not get confused. Even though I am very conscious about certain writing skills, there are still writing skills I need to develop. One writing skill that I feel as though I need to improve is my ability to analyze quotes that I include in a piece of writing. Without a proper analysis, the quote is meaningless to the reader. No matter how fitting a quote may seem to me, it is nearly impossible for the reader to make any sense of it if it does not have a proper set up before it and analysis after it. I think improving this skill will enhance the research essays I write throughout my time in college here at SUNY Geneseo. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brittney Wolter ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I usually focus on finding quotes or certain examples that back up what I'm writing about. I format my writing how I learned in High School. So, it goes Introduction with thesis statement, or the question I'm trying to answer. Then, I do my body paragraphs, next I do the opposition paragraph. And finally, I do the conclusion. This skill is important in my development of writing because it lets me show both sides of an argument. It also allows me to show all the facts/quotes/examples I need to back up my claim. Plus, I can always reuse this format for all my writings. I've had a lot of help with the development of my writing style from teachers and classmates. Their feedback always helps better my work. I always get feedback on the way I use transitions in different paragraphs. I run out of different words to use. For example, I always use "therefore", "then", "For example", and "As shown", etc. My teachers helped me use more words and how to start a paragraph without using one. I would love to be able to get better at the use of commas. In my senior year of high school, my English teacher said I comma splice and use commas wrong. But she never really helped me to change it or learn how to do it better. So, that would be something I really want to work on in this course. Maybe, I could get practice examples to do and try to fix this problem. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Corey Wolfe ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} The aspect of my academic writing that I find most important to focus on is my introduction. I find myself rewriting and rewording my introductions constantly when writing a paper. Over my years in school I've learned that having a strong and clear introduction is crucial for the reader to be able to understand what I am talking about and where I'm going with it. I have always struggled with writing, but luckily, I have had lots of help to improve. I've especially had lots of help from my past teachers and professors. Last semester in my Business Ethics class, I had a good explanation of what the important elements of good writing are. Professor Savage stressed the importance of the introduction to me. She mentioned if the introduction isn't strong the reader will be confused the whole paper. That made a lot of sense to me so, as I continued to write I paid more attention to my introduction and started to see my grades improve. This especially helped while writing an argumentative paper last semester. The assignment asked to decide if I believed a chemical company had made an ethical decision. I spent a very long time wording my intro because I knew that if it wasn't clear, the reader would not understand my opinion and reasoning clearly. Learning this was a big deal because I believe some of my past struggles in writing had to do with my introduction, so it's nice to finally see some improvement. Something I continue to struggle with in my writing is poor organization skills. I want for my writing to have a clear direction it is going in and be easy to follow. Although this sounds very general I've had many teachers in the past mention this to me and I feel I can improve on it. Some ways I could improve on this is reading more and by having a clear view of what I am writing for and about. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Dylan Winne ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Dylan]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Due 2/10/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [1.While writing an essay I try and focus on the big picture of the essay how I can interconnect all my paragraphs and points within them to create a coherent argument. I understand that this might sound a little generic but in my opinion by looking at the big picture it allows you to understand where you must put your detail. I was taught this in middle school and it has stuck with me, that without structure without fine tuning a essay can easily miss the mark in terms of quality and coherency. I incorporate these ideas into my writing by before my draft writing out what my thesis is going to be or at least the points it should cover then create an outline detailing all of the important context and facts that must be known to support my thesis and then I do a stream of consciousness trying to get all my thoughts out there then follow that up with a proof read in order to organize my writing then viola you have a first draft. An example of doing this was last semester I wrote a paper discussing how citizens affected by the South African Apartheid used art for rebellion and self expression.

An example of this would be from one of my old essays; "We used to be best friends," Claire said. "I don't know what happened between us but I need you to explain." Kelsey signed and replied, "You weren't respecting me anymore," Kelsey said looking at Claire. "Everything was always about you and never about me." A way that I would rewrite it to correct it would be: "We used to be best friends" Claire said, "I do not know what happened between us, but I need you to explain." Kelsey sighed and replied "You weren't respecting me anymore. Everything was always about you and never about me." It's something I've been trying to figure out how to do right for years but I was always too scared to ask because it seems like something that everyone should know.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Something that is something that I've been working on and look for most in my essays is organization. I love creative writing and when I start typing something my mind goes all over the place. I just sit and write everything that comes to mind about the subject until I'm out of things to say. By doing this method of writing my thoughts end up scattered all over the essay. So, I go back through my essay and try to organize it better weather it's deleting sentences or moving paragraphs around. There is a lot in my writing that I would like to improve, and I look forward to this class helping me learn more.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jessica Wilk ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jessica Wilk]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self Reflection]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [2/6/19]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While writing for school papers, I have learned and tried to focus more on various transitions when incorporating quotes. I feel that by doing this in my writing it adds more depth and variation to what I am saying. In the past, I would not include different sentence variation and this would sound repetitive in my writing style. I focus now more on how I introduce my quotes. To do this, I read out loud my essays. If I catch myself using the same introduction to my sentence structure, I then will fix my mistakes. This can be seen in my most previous essay. I included, "In Hurston's view," " In other words," and " Baldwin conveys." By using a different lead before introducing a quote, this concept helps my writing progress and have more voice. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While continuing my writing here at Geneseo, and with a future career, I hope to improve my skills of comma placement. In my current writing, I tend to add extra commas than necessary. This can cause confusion to the reader by seeing comma splices in my writing. I will aim to fix this skill throughout my academic career by taking more time when writing my sentences. This may help me by catching avoidable errors in my current writing, and will hopefully help me in the future by knowing when and when not to add commas in my writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} (241 words) ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Quinnlin Wilcox ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Quinnlin Wilcox Often times when I write I tend to make many grammatical mistakes, such as not adding enough punctuation or placing it in the wrong place. This can lead to my writing be harder to understand and being inconvenient to those reading it. Because of this I tend to go through my work several times re-reading and fixing grammatical mistakes and fixing the overall ease of reading my papers. The last time I emailed my professor just telling him I was sick I went back to read through what I had written and there was practically no transition between any ideas leading for it to sound like I had written demanding him to tell me to do something instead of asking him if there was anything extra I could do to make up work. After I had finished going through it and fixing my mistakes it read the way I meant it to. I informed him I was sick then asking if there was a good time I could meet with him in the near future to make sure I understood the reading. One thing I definitely want to Improve while at Geneseo is my ability to come up with a unique thesis and defend that point. In high school while we had to write our thesis, the topic was always chosen for us. So while most theses were worded differently they all really said the same thing. While at Geneseo I want to be able to come up with a completely unique thesis and be able to articulate exactly why I believe this to an academic community. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Burke Whitcomb ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I tend to focus on imagery in my writings. Having this skill did not come naturally, however, it was taught to me by an eight grade English teacher. He helped to recognize that imagery is vital when writing, because the words on the paper directly influence what your reader is imagining in their head. Not many people view imagery as the vital writing element that it is, and because I have recognized its importance I feel as though my essays are very visually stimulating. Instead of saying that I "woke up in a dorm room" instead I would say "I woke slowly as the sun peaked into my poorly lit dorm room. Ramen wrappers slowly became illuminated as the light filtered through the blinds into the room." I feel as though developing this aspect of my writing has helped me greatly, because I am able to more fully control what my readers are imagining as they read my essays. However, developing a wider vocabulary would undoubtedly assist me in creating a more descriptive and visual aspect to my writings. I could supplement this by using a thesaurus or simply by reading more essays written by my peers. I could also research articles or other web entries to see what experts have to say about whatever topic I am writing about. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katherine Welch ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [My tenth-grade English teacher asked me to write a paragraph about my day and graph the number of words in each sentence. The graph was almost a straight line, hovering close to forty words per sentence. Although each one was grammatically correct, they were so long that you had to read them twice to remember how they started. I began focusing on writing more concise sentences. Instead of writing "In her novel, "Girls to the Front", Sara Marcus shares the stories of the young women who were a part of the often forgotten riot grrl movement and challenged authority by being messy, unique, confident, loud, and everything society told the women of the riot grrl movement they were not supposed to be", I began crafting sentences that were much easier to understand. I edited the previous sentence to read "In her novel, 'Girls to the Front', Sara Marcus shares the untold story of the Riot Grrl movement. The movement was messy, loud, and everything a young woman was not supposed to be". Learning how to break up a sentence into manageable pieces and remove redundancies made my writing clearer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving forward, I would like to experiment with more complex punctuation. I have a general understanding of when and how to use colons, semicolons, and dashes, but rarely apply this knowledge to my own writing. Sometimes, I become complacent and write simple sentences because it's easy. More often, I use complex punctuation and delete it while editing because I\'m afraid I used it incorrectly. I plan on using advanced punctuation more confidently and often in the future.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Elias Ward ======================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [During high school I did not get much good feedback on my writing for some reason. As soon as I wrote my first essays at Geneseo however, I received plenty. Writing for my African American history class opened my eyes to what I could be doing better in my writing. For instance, sometimes I use the work 'that' when it is not needed. I understand this is common among writers and I have tried to fix this. It is an easy fix. All I do is go through my writing multiple times and delete the unneeded phrases such as 'that.' For example, "Louisiana slaves that were then able to live away from their workplace and find a job to start making money on their free time had better chances." Removing the term 'that' makes the sentence better and flow. One aspect I would like to take with me is trying to not just explicitly state facts. I\'d rather have a more elaborate statement that the reader can draw from. I am trying to get over the hump of doing this but I am not yet successful. Sometimes I can even do this in my thesis statements which really ends up weakening them. I would say for example, "This is why Lebron James is the best basketball player to ever live." Instead, I am trying to get into the habit of saying, "With Lebron James being able to guard all five positions on the court, winning three gold medals, having 217 playoff games played, and still in his prime, he is the best basketball player to ever walk the Earth." I feel like if I could get better at this during the spring semester, I can excel as a writer.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Stephen Walter ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Stephen Walter Self Reflection 1 When writing I focus most on explaining evidence and how it connects to the claim. Providing evidence is how I back up my claims, after the evidence is provided is where I focus the most on because it is very important to explain how the evidence connects to the argument or claim. If the evidence cannot be explained then it Is harder to explain the claim. In High School I thought I wrote one of the better papers of my life and I got it back and was very upset. I did not do well at all and I was confused at where I went wrong. Then I went over the essay with my English teacher and she said "you did a great job explaining the quotes and what they meant however you never mentioned how they relate to your claim". That is when I started to really focus on providing and explaining that connection and started seeing its importance. For example after the evidence is provided I would explain the quote and its meaning, "In A Study in Scarlett Holmes is referring to a previous mark on the wall that meant revenge". I would explain the quote but not relate it to the main point of the paper. Now I would add something like, "This shows that Hope was committing these murders because of revenge proving Holmes argument that Hope is guilty of murder because of his vengeance".[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} []{.Apple-tab-span} Now and in the future I want to try and focus on making my papers more exciting and more fun to read. Trying to use better words and not be repetitive. I think my work now is good but somewhat boring and needs a little juice. I think I write fast and put down one of the first words that comes to mind instead of thinking about an alternative word that could be more powerful or persuasive. I want to focus more on knowing when to apply these words to and not have it be too excessive because I feel as if it is good to get right to the point in papers.[ ]{.Apple-converted-space} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Lacey Walsh ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} I focus most on having a good format and flow in my writing. I do this by first making an outline with subtopics for each paragraph and considering if the points I'm bringing up make sense in that order. My English teacher was very adamant about this and trying to guide up into a more coherent writing style. During senior year I wrote a short research paper about the Hitler Youth and I followed my teacher's advice. My topic sentences included; "According to Adolf Hitler, the perfect German had the traits of blonde hair...", "In 1936, young boys' hearts all across Germany were crushed...", "The Nazi group had other benefits...", **"**In the classroom and in the Hitler Youth", "The Hitler youth were brainwashed to believe". I feel as though this was a good layout for the task at hand. I believe that by doing this in my writing it allows the reader to understand the points I'm making easier. One aspect I can definitely improve on is the effectiveness of my introductions and conclusions. I try to change my approach to them depending on the paper topics, but I feel as though they are lacking something. I think I could use some help with making them more sophisticated. I believe that a strong paper has a conclusion that reiterates the main idea in a unique way. With putting more focus on my introduction and conclusion my papers will become more cohesive. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Gabriella Walsh ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I tend to focus strongly on creating solid thematic statements and organizing my essay in a structured manner that flows and is easy to comprehend. Doing so ensures that the reader understands the point I am trying to get across and that the essay itself is logical and I do not go on rambling or stray too far from my central focus. Through writing various essays for classes in high school, as well as numerous essays and papers for college applications, I have been able to further focus on structuring my writing and ensuring that my major points are clear, logical, and concise. As I work to rewrite my initial draft, a statement such as "There are many reasons for using social media" turns into the much clearer statement, "There are two main reasons for using social media: to interact with friends, and to interact with companies and brands", which introduces the topic I will expand upon in the writing that follows. After I create the opening sentence, I make sure what follows is logical and follows an order that makes sense to the reader.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In my future writing endeavors, I would like to focus more on using more examples to support my thoughts. I tend to rely too much on the opening statements itself and failing to provide enough evidence to back it up.

This makes my paper, more fluent and clear all the way throughout it. I used to struggle on making the exact point clear in high school so now I focus heavy on that which has led to me struggling in other areas. One area I struggle in, especially in formal writing is using contractions instead of using the words written out. For example I often say "I'm" instead of "I am". This is an easy fix I just need to focus on keeping it consistent. In the future I plan to work on fixing my issue and using less contrsctions when writing papers for my classes. This can improve my writing a lot and make it flow much better. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Michael Wood ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Michael Wood]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD 106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1: My Writing Priorities]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ [One aspect of my academic writing that I am currently working on correcting is the bad habit of "quote lumps." Throughout my years many English teachers have seen this in my writing and pointed it out to me. Quoting is an excellent way of establishing credibility and meaning to my writing, so it is important that I revise this. By thinking of a quote like a sandwich, with the introduction as the top piece of bread and the explanation and analysis as the bottom piece of bread, I can drastically improve this important writing skill. For example, in my ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Lord of the Flies]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ essay from high school I stated, "A quote that tells us this " ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill! You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close! I'm the reason why it's no go? Why things are what they are?" (Golding). I added no other explanation and simply just left that mess of quote at the end of a paragraph. A better example of this quote would look like: "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The idea that perhaps the beast is only the boys themselves is exemplified in Simon's hallucination when the beast says, "]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill! You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you." (Golding). This line expresses the theme that evil is in human nature and the presence of a "beast" is really just the inner corruption of humanity." In this revised example, I add introduction and analysis by only using part of the quote that I need to prove my argument. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One thing I want to develop even further in my writing is the organization of my writing. More specifically, I want to present my ideas in a very logical order that produces a clear understanding of my claim. Many students usually excel in the English classes at school, while struggling with Mathematics and sciences. I am the opposite. So, I think these INTD classes can help me strengthen my organization and improve my writing skills. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Vera Woodard ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I focus on maintaining consistency throughout a piece of writing. Being consistent when writing is essential because I don't want my work to come across as being contradictory or myself coming across as not knowing the topic that I am discussing. It also destroys the possible barrier of misunderstanding between the reader and I. I want to ensure that the intended message my writing is supposed to convey gets across and is recognized by the reader. Since the majority of my writing is submitted for grading, consistency allows for the grader to easily comprehend my writing and eliminate things that I would likely be penalized for.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In high school, my English teachers always suggested I use an outline for my writing. Having all the components of an essay sketched out made the overall writing process easier, but also made sure that all my ideas coincide with one another. For example, for an essay I wrote in high school about ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Daisy Miller]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ by Henry James, my thesis statement was that Daisy's character traits were "responsible for her downfall and the lack of sympathy she received from other characters". My introductory statement revolves around the idea that there is "appropriate behavior" for certain places and there are consequences one will face if they don't act in accordance with that behavior. And all my topic sentences for my body paragraphs reinforce what I am arguing, as well as the evidence I provide for said body paragraphs. However, with the overwhelming consistency among the arguments in my writing, there isn't enough analysis to back it up. This is a skill I'd like to develop for my writing overall whether it be a piece required for school or something I'm writing on my own. The evidence I provide appears sufficient enough to me to make my argument valid, but my analysis isn't enough to actually prove what I'm arguing.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Brett Woodworth ============================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} When I revise my drafts I always focus on making sure I can explain and expand upon in-text citations because it helps further argue the point I am trying to get across. When you state a quote without explaining its meaning or why it is being used, your paper loses credibility and will have no concrete evidence to argue your point. I am certain I can use this skill with fair precision because of a template that was given to me by one of my high school teachers where I was forced to explain why I used a quote instead of citing it for the sake of citing a quote. It encouraged me to look deeper into the quotes I was using and actually formulate what it meant and how it could help argue my point before using it. A perfect example of this would be I move from saying "This quote shows how Bucky blames himself for leaving the kids behind in Weequahic" to going into more detail and explaining, "This portrays how Bucky has morals that he abides by and feels that it is his duty to protect the kids back in Weequahic although he cannot protect them from polio." The biggest hurdle for me to overcome was to find the deeper meaning of a text or quote, but as time has gone on I've been able to have greater success because of the template by high school teacher gave me. Going forward, I'd like to try and make my essays more concise. I've had many problems in the past with putting too much "fluff" or unneeded information in my essays. Making my essays more concise will help me keep the paper focused and allow me to have a clear goal for my writing. Perhaps, even before writing my essay, I should state a clear goal I want the essay to be about. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: James Wun ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [When it comes to essay writing, one aspect that I always consciously focus on when I\'m revising my drafts is being able to make sure that my evidence that I use for my argument can support my thesis statement and explaining why that evidence supports that claim. This is an important aspect because many people like to provide long summaries of text for their evidence. However, summarizing text only tells the reader what happens in the text, so it is important to explain to the reader why that long text just summarized relates to your thesis statement/the claim that you are trying to support. In high school, I was assigned a research paper of my senior year and I was able to pick the topic. I picked the video game ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[Fortnite]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ and how it was such a successful game. I used many sources to support this argument and summarized lots of text about statistics on the game from the sources that I used, but after every summary, I made sure to relate back to the thesis (why the game gained so much popularity and success). For example, I cited a text from a source and summarized a portion of it that explained the free to play nature of the game. I then explained that this was a reason of why the game gained so much popularity because when a new video game comes out, someone has to be willing to pay 40-60 dollars just to play a game they might not even end up liking, but the free to play nature means that anyone can play without worrying about wasting their money, and if they don't like the game, then they wouldn't have wasted that 40-60 dollars trying it out.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As I will continue to write at Geneseo, one aspect that I would like to develop is being able to write a good conclusion paragraph. Most of the time, I just don't know what to write in my conclusion paragraph and I end up summarizing a lot. At the moment, I only restate my intro and thesis statement, but I would like to develop more about my conclusion. I could restate my evidence used in my body paragraphs and briefly use the evidence that I used, summarizing it into a concise sentence.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Zihong Xiong ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} For me, It is always struggling to write the opening paragraph. So I focus more on the elements in the opening paragraph, especially the thesis statement. A thesis statement is usually a single sentence at the end of the first paragraph that presents an argument to the reader and tells the reader what to expect from the rest of the paper. If the thesis statement states merely facts that there is no argument, it is just a summary. Some words like \'good\' or \'bad\' are too vague that can't show a strong argument. We can write why something is good or bad to make the thesis more specific, or we can provide additional information. I find an example of a week thesis from my draft: 'In the following part, I will discuss the female consciousness of the poet Chaucer in his works.' After rewriting this with a major aspect for my discussion: 'In the following part, I will discuss the female consciousness of the poet Chaucer in his work through the poet\'s shaping of the image of the wife of bath.' To be more precise, I rewrite it as: 'While the feminism sprang up in the middle of 20^th^ Century, I would like to discuss the female consciousness of the poet Chaucer in his work through the poet's shaping of the image of the wife of Bath.' Besides the opening paragraph, I am still trying to improve the ending paragraph. The last paragraph is the key to extend the meaning of the article. I am struggling to outstand the main idea of the article in a different way from the first paragraph. I think I am always restating the first paragraph while writing the last paragraph. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jeffrey Yaw ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Jeffrey Yaw]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Dr. Gillian Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [INTD-106]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [10 February 2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection Essay \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of the most common pieces of feedback I receive in just about any scholarly work (college or high school) is that I write with a very clear voice and style. Voice is important - it tells you who's writing and can even tell you things about the writer. For example, E. E. Cummin- oh, sorry, I mean, ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[e. e. cummings]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ - always stylized his name, because he was a Totally Smart And Poetically Revolutionary Guy and not just a self-important contrarian who wanted to be unique. Ten to one, most people you ask about Cummings would ask in return, "Isn't he the dude that never capitalized his name?" I write with a lot of voice, and a social studies teacher once pointed out something to me that I've never failed since to notice in my writing, and today, actively work on - I use a lot of semicolons, hyphens, and parentheses. Mr. Kashorek, my teacher at the time, pulled me aside. He asked me to read my work aloud just as I do in my head, so I did. Not even halfway through the second paragraph, in the middle of talking about "that rat fink Henry Kissinger, a man I've never met before but can confidently say I'd "accidentally" spill hot coffee all over - the man who single-handedly put the I in War Crimes," he mentioned I must have taken the idea of hyphens to indicate a long pause with no change in tone (and parentheses as staying on topic but changing tone momentarily, an aside, or even a "stage whisper") very literally. I've also learned how to temper this voice for more official things, like final essays or formal emails. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Perhaps this is a little cheat-y, given that the example in the assignment information was on quoting sources, but I'd like to take it the opposite direction - I feel like I don't elaborate thoroughly enough. Sure, I cite plenty of sources and go into detail about why they matter and what they show, but I have a bad habit of assuming that the reader (though this is usually a teacher who, frankly, shouldn't need this explanation, but I digress) sees the connection as easily as I do, which, I've noticed through interactions in classes, isn't a universal truth.

Having reliable sources in my paper not only helps to reinforce my purpose but it also helps to build an argument and purpose. The inclusion of evidence provides the reader an insight on where I stand. The ability to successfully incorporate outside sources derives from the process of pre-writing or "brainstorming," as my high school teachers called it. Brainstorming is essentially a moment before your draft in which you plan and outline the different aspects of your writing. You include main ideas that you would like to touch upon as well as reliable evidence to support your main ideas. Brainstorming has helped me keep my paper organized and straight to the point. Brainstorming allows me, the writer, to incorporate evidence in a smooth transitional way that does not seem jagged. An example of a jagged transition would be, "Coral reef bleaching is due to many things such as 'tourism and fishing'. 'These activities pose serious threat to the recovering corals..." (Diraviya et.al, 2018, p.386). This sentence is incomplete and the transition from one idea of evidence to the other is abrupt. A better example would be, "According to Diraviya et. al "...tourism and fishing...pose a serious threat to the recovering coral." After having incorporated evidence, I end with a concluding sentence such as, "Hence, these activities should be regulated." Brainstorming is a great tool to utilize. It allows, me, the writer to better format the forthcoming paper. I have previously been told that brainstorming has lead to a better incorporation of my evidence.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [ Within my time at Geneseo, I would like to develop better transitioning sentences. Regardless of whether or not I effectively incorporate evidence, I can not be fully dependent on that of my outside sources to shape my writing. Transition sentences help to maneuver my writing from one point to another. Even if I am able to effectively incorporate evidence, it does not help my writing if I am unable to connect the ideas made in one paragraph to the other. Transition sentences allow me to effectively introduce a new idea and still have the developed ideas connect to previous points made. Transitioning sentences can be difficult to incorporate but perhaps I could use transition words to help connect ideas from one paragraph to the other.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Edward Zajac ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} In my writing, I find that I tend to over-explain ideas, resulting in run-on sentences. When I revise my drafts, I look for some of my longer sentences and edit them for conciseness. Doing so gives every sentence a singular purpose instead of attempting to fit many ideas in one place. I have found that shortening run-on sentences makes my writing clearer, and more representative of my ideas. My awareness of this writing flaw came from a visit to the Writing Learning Center at Geneseo. Going over my paper with an English major highlighted a mistake that I would not have noticed when editing on my own. Another set of eyes on my paper and a live discussion accompanying it proved to be a vital asset to improving my writing. One of my revised sentences originated from a philosophy paper on morality. My original run-on sentence: "Euthyphro and Plato have a discussion on the roof, talking about the justification behind the death sentence of man and what grounds call for a man's execution." I attempted to discuss two ideas in the same sentence, resulting in neither being fleshed out to it's fullest potential. My edited sentences: "Euthyphro and Plato stood out on the roof for hours, discussing issues of morality. They lingered on the justification behind the execution of a man and debated on what makes an act ethical." Not only was I able to make both ideas more concise, but I delivered them in a clearer manner as well. To further develop my writing, I intend to take all my papers and works to be seen by someone else to discuss my mistakes. For writing at Geneseo and beyond, I would like to gain the ability to write captivating work. The ability to create works that make a person want to continue reading and become genuinely interested in my writing would be a valuable skill to develop. While I am not an experienced writer, I look forward to writing in the future, to turn one of my weaknesses into a strength. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Emily Zenger ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} Self-Reflection \#1 INTD 106 2/9/19 Emily Zenger When revising my drafts, I look for errors in word usage such as tense changes while talking about the same topic. I took a creative nonfiction class during my senior year, and my teacher pointed out that when I started to use the first person in my writing, I kept switching tenses when I shouldn't have. A good example of this can be explained through my final sociology paper last semester. The topic was about racist stereotypes in Disney classics. When referring to what was happening in the movie, I used the present tense. When referring to how this mirrored to reality, I used the past tense. These can be mixed-up without careful revision. It is important to look out for this because even though I might know what I'm talking about, changing tense within the same piece or portion can confuse the reader. Maintaining clear direction through consistent verb tense makes an essay more "readable," something that is key in the rubric for INTD 105. This detail is essential in all writing due keeping readability in essays for this semester's class, as well. Moving forward, although I still need to keep an eye out for that bad habit, I should focus on how to make my writing in a more direct manner. In the last few papers I have written in college, the page count has gone over the maximum stated by the professor. I like to make sure my audience is properly informed within the right context, but with practice and peer editing I could probably do so in the requirements made by the instructor. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Katrina Zielinski =============================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of writing that I tend to consciously focus on is stating all essential topics involved in my essay, in my introduction paragraph. By addressing my key points, I am able to keep my work more clearly organized and on topic. I normally always remember to try and use this technique because of my English teacher in high school. She taught and reminded me for almost all my essays that I needed to have a strong thesis and to outline the main discussion paragraphs of my piece. Originally, I would start by saying "Characterization of Daisy helped to present that women are judged for their actions which impacts their reputation, whereas men weren't." By critiquing my writing with the help of my English teacher I added more description to my argument to say, "Characterization of Daisy and Winterbourne helps to show that reputation is based on one's background, culture, and gender." From these two sentences, I then laid out my paragraphs on background, culture and gender all relating back to the theme. By stating the topics of my three paragraphs I was able to clearly portray my thoughts for the reader to understand. Throughout college I would like to work on the complexity of my writing. I normally have very basic word choice and would like to sound more professional and knowledgeable when writing. At times feel like my writing seems much less intelligent than others because of my word choice. Throughout all my previous writing pieces I have selected words that seem simple in my writing and tried to replace them with more advanced words and more complex sentences. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Grant Zucker ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Grant Zucker ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I focus on making sure I introduce my quotes in an intelligent coherent matter while not being too repetitive. Out of habit I always say "for example" then just state my quote which is boring and doesn\'t really ease the reader into the quote it just blatantly states it. Some guidance and feedback I received are too use different ways to introduce quotes. A good example is to say " according to X" or "in X view" these are both good templates that I can use to further help me introduce my quotes. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[They Say I Say]{style="font-weight: 400;"}*[ is a very useful resource in writing an essay and I plan to start using it for my future essays to become a more fluent writer.

Writing with sophisticated vocabulary allows me to come across more professional, however, sometimes it confuses the reader because I am not saying what needs to be said in the most direct way. If and when the reader loses the ability to comprehend, the entire piece becomes invaluable lacking any real substantial content. On the flip side, when I use lower more casual vocabulary, the reader can build a preconception of me and may believe I do not know the topic I am discussing thoroughly. I wrote in my college essay assigned in English 12, "My family of five expanded to by another person which multiplied to seven after a handful of years in which my brothers were born." My English teacher found it very difficult to conceptualize this sentence. She critiqued that there were too many words so the sentence lost meaning. She questioned if the brothers were the next two individuals and why the word "multiply" was used because nothing was truly being multiplied. She told me to look at my writing a few days later and read it out loud. When I did this I realized I barely knew what I was trying to say either. Together we corrected the sentence into being, "Five became six which then grew to seven over the course of the next few years when my two younger brothers entered the world.". This sentence is much more direct yet still offers a sophisticated tone. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Throughout INTD I would like to focus on not having run on sentences. I feel sometimes I do or rely on a comma when it is not necessary. I feel learning this skill will help me be more efficient in writing. I could do more peer reviewing and having someone read my work to me out loud, this way it is easier to find run on sentences. I am not as comfortable in a large group setting so having one or two other people help me would be very beneficial.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Camryn Arthur =========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Camryn Arthur]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Self-Reflection \#1]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Professor Paku]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [02/10/2019]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [While I write, my main focus is continuously making my word choice better and improving how my sentences connect. These are both important concepts in writing; strong word choice can make essays intriguing and captivate readers. It also can help the composition come together more intelligently. After improving my word choice, my next step to excel in writing was to focus on the flow of my sentences. The flow of the sentence is vital for my essays to come together using both informed word choice and connecting sentences to better prove my point in the essay topic. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [During my four or five years at SUNY Geneseo I hope to improve more on my grammatical errors that occur during writing, my biggest struggle is knowing where my punctuation goes. I can begin to do this on my own my proof-reading out loud and having others listen to my essay. An example would be, "Some way that the government can change the laws to make safer schools is by gun control if the US had gun control the mass shooting can be decreased." If I had read this out loud I would have heard wording choice errors, instead of is; use would be. Alternatively, another case "The tasks can include deep research of the person background of financial records, mental health records, and other personal information." In this sentence, the word profound should say in-depth, I can avoid these problems easily by moving slower through my writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} \ \ ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Olivia Armao ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I pivot my writing around anticipating reader's questions as I'm aware that good writing doesn't serve the writer but rather the reader. While there are many keys to "good writing," one that may overlook is knowing ahead of time what the reader is going to ask of what you have to say, and how you can remedy that before they get the chance to ask. I struggled with being a boring writer in AP Literature my senior year, and my teacher helped me to fix the vague arguments I was making. She reminded me that writing is not meant for yourself, that it's meant to be read and related to by others. It's about what you are trying to say, what words you can use to express it, and how you can make it clear to your reader. While writing college application essays I would often introduce a subject but not elaborate on how I had gotten to that point in my life or what it meant to me. Going from "I'm a part of my high school\'s National Honors Society" to "Being a dedicated and hard working student gave me the ability to join National Honors Society" gave me the aura of a student colleges were looking for, instead of leaving them wondering how I arrived at that stage. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In the future, I would like to adjust my writing to tell a whole story. Too often I leave out opposing viewpoints, therefore my writing sounds like a press release. Relying too much on opinion in my writing allows space for the reader to develop distrust in me. However, by incorporating multiple perspectives, I can persuade the writer to lean in one direction or the other, making my argument shockproof. While there are many areas to work on in my writing, acknowledging other points of view allows a bridge of trust between writer and reader that I believe is essential to good writing. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sam Aranoff ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of my writing that I feel is particularly strong, is my ability to form an informative introductory statement, without using a generic format to get my point across to the reader. When writing an introduction, I try to begin with a broad statement relating to the main idea, and from that point follow it up with relevant information to reach my main point of the essay. This makes it easy to draw in the reader, without having to begin with just a thesis statement. For example, in the introduction to my paper on Malla Nunn's "Let the Dead Lie," I began with "Throughout the world, countless instances of race inequality exist..." in order to set the stage on one of the overall messages the book conveys, while giving me an easy transition to follow up on the main points being made by the author, without having to change the subject. With this opening statement, I am free to focus in on the location the book takes place in, while maintaining relevancy to my claim," A great example is in South Africa, where almost everything in one's life can be determined by skin color alone...". These branching statements allow me to freely jump into my main claims about the main character, without giving a full-on summary of the book. In the future I would like to improve my argumentative essay skills as I find myself struggling with giving both sides an equal amount of detail before jumping into why one of them is correct over the other. I feel that if I focus too much on the opposing argument, my main argument will suffer in its overall legitimacy, possibly swaying the reader to support a specific side that was not initially intended. Forming a more balanced argument will improve the structure of my writing, giving both sides a cohesive structure, before pushing to support the argument being focused on. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Michael Antici ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [A main focus in my writing is the establishment of a clear and interesting thesis. A clear thesis is crucial in proving the point of your paper forward. It also helps hook the reader and should make them engage in the rest of the paper. I first started to develop a good thesis in my AP World class in 10th grade. This was my first time experiencing college level writing and it was a real skill I needed to learn to be successful. My teacher stressed that you needed to introduce your argument and draw interest from the reader. Although she said you cannot make it to long as its harder to prove multiple arguments and it creates an unorganized paper. A thesis I would have wrote back then might have went like this, "The Declaration of Independence was an important document in the history of the United States, it paved the way for the birth of the new nation by listing the reasons of separation from Britain. The document was highly influential to the ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and they share many similarities]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[". This thesis drags on substantially and is very confusing. My teacher would have us write these longer thesis statements out and try to simplify and make it more compact and understandable. A thesis I would use now would be much simpler. "The Declaration of Independence is extremely influential over ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen as they both use similar strategies to declare independence over their former government". Here I cut out a substantial amount of the filler I was previously using. It was distracting to the reader and blurred the point of the rest of the paper.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [As for my writing onward id like to improve my editing and grammar skills. Sometimes I find that I am extremely lazy with my editing. Im looking to find strategies to improve my editing, as well as engage in peer review of my writing. I\'ve grown way too connected to auto-correct and it has hurt the quality of my writing as I feel like I miss a lot more than I did when I edited by hand. I would like to start editing on paper again as it helped me re-read and find mistakes I would have missed.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Arham Ansari ========================================================== ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [I think the strongest part in my writing is being able to build upon quotations and/or information. I am able to create a strong argument and then use two different reliable sources to show how experts in a topic agree or disagree. This allows me to use two strong quotations concurrently. I have learned to do this because of my AP Research class in high school that was focused on studying a complex topic of your choice and one of the biggest things in this class was reading scholarly articles and being able to use them correctly in your work and use them with each other. For example, before I was really taught this skill I would say something along the lines of "Dr. Robert believes that crime prevention programs do not work, but other experts in the field say otherwise." Whereas now I can use different authors to help support or oppose one another like, " Dr. Robert believes that, crime prevention programs do not prevent crime and that rehabilitation programs are also not beneficial (Ross, 1985). This has been argued by several others, such as Dr. Craig Haney who states ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[many positive effects of the BPI program and rehabilitation programs in general in many experiments." ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [One of the things I have the most trouble with in writing is organization. Although this may seem like a "simple" skill I feel that I have a hard time organizing my paragraphs fluently. Many times I will try to outline my essays before hand to help but still have received a lot of constructive criticism that I write about things in the wrong places or just did not organize in the best way possible. Perhaps I can try and outline my essays in more than one way and see which might work the best. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Luke Andres ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One primary aspect of my academic writing that I consciously focus on is creating an introduction that clearly outlines the remainder of the piece. This organization helps the reader follow all the arguments being made as well as serving as an additional outline for the order of your thoughts. During a history course I took first semester, my professor gave me the advice of thinking of an introduction as a road map through your writing. This was demonstrated in an essay I wrote in this same class later in the semester where I wrote "In *The Promised Land,* Mary Antin tells the story of her life as a young Jewish girl in Russia and her families journey to the United States. Antin's autobiography shows America in an overwhelmingly positive light, especially when compared to the conditions she faced in her home country." This helps set up the body paragraphs where you go into more detail on each topic. One aspect of my writing that I believe I could benefit from improving is citations. Many of my previous classes have not put much emphasis on citations, but with new academic policies, specifically regarding plagiarism, I believe it is an important skill to learn. I typically know when I need to add citations, but struggle to know what type to use in various situations. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Ana Amorim da Silva Gusmini ========================================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Ana Clara Amorim da Silva Gusmini (Ana Gusmini) ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Writing for me is not the easiest thing in the world. I barely learnt how to properly write an essay, until I moved to New York State for my senior year. Writing really challenges me, but once I have a topic in my head and it really interests me, I do a pretty good job. I like to focus on the backstory of my essays, why am i writing it? What is the point of the argument, why does it interest me, and what are people going to take out of what i wrote. My strengths in writing are that i bring my own experiences into my writing, making it more personal. I take all of what I have learned so far, and put it into the paper. I like to have that strength because I believe it makes me a more complete writer, i care about what feelings people might have when they read my pieces. I think a paper is important to have sentimental meanings and an emotional turnout. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Something that I would like to improve in my writing is being able to write with better word selection. An example of an essay I had to write for my academic writing class, is that on my essay I wrote: " ... that day was really hot and practice was very hard to push through..." to " I was practicing in those scorching summer days to be the best I could\..." At that moment I realized that by only changing one word, or one sentence can make the essay look better and look like it has been written very carefully. My before and after on that essay was very eye opening on realizing that if I take a little longer and pay more attention to minor details my essay can go from a C to an A. ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Julia Amara ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [Throughout my experience with writing, I have noticed a pattern of the same comments from teachers. My writing was too vague and the idea needed to be condensed into a specific concept. I took AP Lang my senior year of high school and I feel that it really did help improve the quality of my writing. However; even the examples to support my claims were not specific enough. For example, in my Romeo and Juliet essay, I started off by saying that Shakespeare uses this literary device of comparison. That was my thesis and there was no explanation or example of how he used that literary device. My hopes for this course is that it will help me to become a stronger academic writer and have more centralized specific ideas.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [In addition to this, I'm hoping to develop a strong central claim. I want my claim to be concise and to the point. Claims are the setup for what your essay is going to be based off of and what you base your examples off of.

Especially if it has to do with similar information I've learned to include different quotes and try to avoid reusing certain phrases, but instead adding new ideas that have yet been brought up and analyze the importance of the quote and how it can impact the paper. I also try not to sound vague when explaining important content rather go into more details about the situation. An example of this would be when I was writing a paper for sociology based on police brutality and I said, " police brutality is still a problem now, even if time passed". I noticed this was very vague and didn't really emphasis a lot so I changed it to, "time has passed by and police brutality is still a problem to this day in which the police is still racially profiling blacks and harming them for inconsequential reasons or no reasons at all". ]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [Moving on throughout my years in Geneseo I would like to develop the strategy on being able to find different sources supporting my argument and knowing how to not always be dependent on the source rather explaining it more in my own words.

Even if the paper isn\'t supposed to be an expressive and original, I find that I can write well based off of my own ideas. I may look toward resources for help when needed, but I never find the need to copy anyone else\'s work. I think it\'s good sometimes to look to other\'s for inspiration, but I\'ve always been good at forming my own thoughts and opinions to get my point across concisely to the reader. For example, instead of saying \"My dog is the best dog in the world\" I would say \"My dog is such a loyal and playful companion in my life. He\'s my best friend and I\'m so incredibly lucky to have him.\" I take what I know about the topic, make sure that I have a point, opinion or thought that I\'m trying to get across, and then add some description and originally to really make it my own. One aspect that I think that I could develop effectively is my use of vocabulary. If I could use more advanced terms in my papers to sound more professional or to even draw the audience into my essay more, I think that this is a conscious effort that I would like to work on in the future. Instead of using the word \"big\", maybe use the words like \"gigantic\" or \"enormous\". I think that this will give my paper a little more flavor for the reader as well as showing a more intelligent approach in my writing.

In high school, my AP Literature teacher would always critique my continuous run on sentences because of my inability to formulate specific and quick points. For example, this is one of my introductory paragraphs that I wrote with two, very long, sentences: \"[Throughout the epic poem "Beowulf," translated by Seamus Heaney, one can infer that although Beowulf\'s name suggests complexity because of his immortale, lone-wolf characteristics, Grendel's identity elicit ambiguity due to his ability to despise yet sympathise with the surrounding world.

Here, I would jot down any key points, examples, and other ideas I wanted to include in my writing piece before even starting my rough draft. Unfortunately, I did not find this solution very useful because I still struggle with creating more independent observations to include in my writing and end up formulating run on sentences that are very redundant, while also using unnecessary comas and semicolons. It is because of this, that my goal for INTD 106 is to better my grammar, use of punctuation, and learn how to formulate more original thoughts and conclusions about the topics I write about. I believe that it is important to have the ability to not only formulate my own academic writing, but also be able to understand and analyze what I am writing about. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Kathryn Capone ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [One aspect of academic writing I have learned to focus on is making sure that I address the other side of my argument accurately and give that other side enough credit. If my writing consists only of my opinion or addresses the other side only in a negative tone, it comes across as bias and strips me of my credibility as a writer. The reader won't take into account my viewpoint if I completely debunk the other side; instead, I learned that it's better to explain the counterargument and dive deeper into why I have issues with it. English teachers would always advocate for this in high school, but they would only require students to mention the counterargument in a sentence or two. It wasn't until college that I really learned how to mention it more in depth. I explored this academic strategy in my Readers and Text class last semester. My teacher explained this concept to us and assigned us an essay in which we practiced it.]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ For instance, one of the strategies he taught us included mentioning something the reader may have a problem with in the writing at first glance, but then arguing why it is necessary. Specifically, I demonstrated this in a piece of writing last semester. I wrote about how the plot in ]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]{style="font-weight: 400;"}[ by Lewis Carroll consisted of nonsense and wrote, "Seemingly, if something doesn't follow the traditional rules previously established, then one would assume there's no point in figuring out the meaning because with the loss of sense, it becomes meaningless. That's where I was wrong. While the story at first glance seems to be one of total nonsense in our understood world, it's important to note how these situations of nonsense are a part of the different world Carroll construed." Here, I explained how I first felt upon reading the story, and then displayed how that way of thinking was wrong and needed reevaluating. I'm glad I learned this skill because previously I wasn't asked to assess the counterargument that much, but by doing so, it can help prove a point even more. While i'm thankful I cultivated this skill, there are still plenty of other areas I can develop more as a writer. One skill I'd like to work on is finding the best quotes that prove my point. The quotes I normally pick out are fine, but I want them to be the most relevant and helpful for explaining my ideas to the reader.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Edward Buckton ============================================================ ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [**Self-Reflection \#1**]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} An aspect of academic writing I like to focus on is the conclusion. This part of the academic writing process is an excellent opportunity to clarify the points you want the reader to take away from the essay. This can be especially useful if your argument has been a complex or nuanced one, as readers can become lost in the large number of cited texts and counter-points one has provided throughout. One excellent piece of advice I got with regard to conclusions was in my first semester of university in the UK. A lecturer advised me that I should think of the conclusion not only as a summarisation of the essay, but as a "so what?" paragraph, illustrating how these points are relevant in "the bigger picture". A poor conclusion might simply start with "In conclusion, Cox's studies show that putting pepperoni on pizza will lead to an unpleasant taste". Conversely, a more sophisticated final paragraph will describe the implications of this conclusion in a wider context; "...these points all lead to the conclusion that pepperoni and pizza is an unpleasant combination. This perhaps explains why the pepperoni industry has been struggling in a modern business environment". In future, I am keen to focus on improving my referencing techniques in academic writing. In my last major assignment, I lost points as I had failed to cite my source texts properly, only noting down the author and publication date of each book, and not the individual pages my quotes were from. By working on this simple technique, I can make sure to avoid similar pitfalls and improve my grades, as well as the integrity of my writing as an academic, in any subject. ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Sara Bray ======================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} [The majority of my writing focuses on the thesis in the introduction and what I am trying to say. By zeroing in on what I will write for a thesis, I am able to have a concrete idea of what evidence I can use to back it up. If I am able to come up with a foundation for what my ideas are, I am able to deduce evidence from certain texts and I am able to further analyze a piece. I was influenced to write better theses in high school by my AP Literature teacher. My teacher always said to make a thesis stand out and jump at the audience with a new lense, otherwise, what I write will not provoke any thought. My initial thesis stated "fate is always accompanied by death." Looking at that sentence, it is obvious that your fate eventually leads up to being dead. By looking at my drafts of the theses I write, I am able to think of a better way to let the reader better understand what idea I would like to convey. In the piece I wrote, I changed my drafts of the theses to a more complex meaning of a simple idea: "death cannot be tamed; as much as we are afraid of it, we must accept our fate in life." It is still the same meaning, but portrays more analysis. The idea of improving a thesis helps me think about what message I would like to end up portraying to the reader throughout the piece.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} [I would love to improve my writing in essays by being able to critically think about what I am writing about and why others care about what I have to say. The majority of my writing responds to quotes and facts. Much of what I say summarizes what cannot be debated or cannot be thought about in a more complex way. I would like to evoke thinking in those that read my pieces at Geneseo and in the future. In doing so, my writing will drastically improve and I will have a more influential voice.]{style="font-weight: 400;"} ::: Self-Reflection \#1: Your Writing Priorities: Jada Atwood ========================================================= ::: {style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;"} One aspect of academic writing I already focus on when revising my drafts is looking at the paper as a whole to strengthen the way I organized and demonstrated my argument. I do this by checking that I am using strong topic sentences and transitions. I make sure I have adequately integrated and analyzed quotations, as well as checking that my paper is free from grammar and spelling errors that might impede my ability to communicate my point. Additionally, I check to make sure my thesis clearly states my argument and its significance. In my American History: Constitution class last semester, we were writing an essay on the ratifying conventions. I did not have a thesis, instead ending my introduction like this, "The state's New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts each played an important role in the ratification of the Constitution." However, when I went back to revise, I realized that it was not a proper thesis statement. Thus, I revised my introduction by adding, "The debate between the Antifederalists and Federalists helped to shape a document which emphasized both centralized government and the protection of individual rights." This new thesis clearly stated my argument and also connected my main arguments in each body paragraph to the thesis. An aspect I want to develop effectively for writing at Geneseo is, I would like to learn how to properly organize my ideas into a cohesive essay. I am able to come up with several ideas but, I am unable to connect these ideas well. Consequently, my essays usually turn out disorganized because I am jumping from idea to idea without any conclusion or connection between them. For instance, in another essay in my history class on the Fourteenth Amendment, I was discussing the Plessy v. Ferguson case. After concluding that main point, I immediately start discussing the Brown v. Board of Education case without describing how the two cases were related. Overall, I want to develop skills that will help organize my ideas so I can write a clear and concise essay. :::
